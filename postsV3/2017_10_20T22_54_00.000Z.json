    "title": "<i>Uḷḷadu Nāṟpadu</i>: Tamil text, transliteration and translation",
    "content": "<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\" trbidi=\"on\">As I explained at the beginning of my previous article, <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2017/09/upadesa-undiyar-tamil-text.html\"><i>Upadēśa Undiyār</i>: Tamil text, transliteration and translation</a>, <i>Nāṉ Yār?</i>, <i>Upadēśa Undiyār</i> and <i>Uḷḷadu Nāṟpadu</i> are the three texts in which Bhagavan expressed the fundamental principles of his teachings in the most clear, coherent, comprehensive and systematic manner, which is why these are the three texts that I cite most frequently on this blog, and therefore friends often ask me for my complete translation of each of them. My <a href=\"http://happinessofbeing.com/nan_yar.html\">translation of <i>Nāṉ Yār?</i></a> has been available on my website for many years, and for a long time I have been meaning to post my complete translations of <i>Upadēśa Undiyār</i> and <i>Uḷḷadu Nāṟpadu</i> there also, but somehow I did not get round to doing so till recently, when I finally decided that I should put it off no longer. Therefore having posted my translation of <i>Upadēśa Undiyār</i> in <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2017/09/upadesa-undiyar-tamil-text.html\">my previous article</a>, in this one I give a fresh translation of <i>Uḷḷadu Nāṟpadu</i>, which is a carefully revised and refined version of all my earlier translations of it.<br><a name='more'></a>\n<br>\nOf all the works of Bhagavan, <i>Uḷḷadu Nāṟpadu</i> is arguably the most fundamental and important text, and I think it would be no exaggeration to say that unless one has imbibed to a considerable extent the full import of these forty-two verses (two <i>maṅgalam</i> verses and forty verses of the main text) by carefully studying and reflecting deeply on the meaning of each of them and the close and coherent connections between the ideas expressed in them, and of course by trying as much as possible to follow the simple path of self-investigation that he teaches in them, it is not possible for one to adequately grasp and appreciate the real depth and radical import of his teachings, because many of the key principles of his teachings are expressed nowhere as clearly and coherently as they are in these verses.<br>\n<br>\nFor example, in <i>Uḷḷadu Nāṟpadu</i> he makes it abundantly clear why self-investigation (<i>ātma-vicāra</i>) is the only means by which we can eradicate ego (the first person or subject) and hence all its progeny (all second and third persons or objects), because ego, which he describes in <a href=\"#un25\">verse 25</a> as a ‘formless phantom’, is a false self-awareness — an awareness of ourself as a body composed of five sheaths (as he points out in verses <a href=\"#un05\">5</a> and <a href=\"#un24\">24</a>), whereas what we actually are is not any such transient phenomenon but just pure, infinite, indivisible, eternal and immutable awareness (as he points out in verses <a href=\"#un12\">12</a> and <a href=\"#un13\">13</a>) — and it comes into seeming existence and stands only by grasping the form of a body as itself, and it nourishes and sustains itself by grasping other forms (that is, by being aware of anything other than itself), so it will dissolve and disappear only when it tries to grasp itself (that is, only when it investigates itself so keenly that it ceases to be aware of anything else). He also makes it clear (for example, in verses <a href=\"#un06\">6</a>, <a href=\"#un07\">7</a>, <a href=\"#un14\">14</a>, <a href=\"#un23\">23</a> and <a href=\"#un26\">26</a>) that everything else seems to exist only when we are aware of ourself as this ego or mind, because all other things (all phenomena) are forms that we perceive only when we perceive ourself as a form (as he says in verses <a href=\"#un04\">4</a> and <a href=\"#un05\">5</a>), so when this ego does not exist nothing else exists, and hence investigating what this ego is is giving up everything (as he says in <a href=\"#un26\">verse 26</a>).<br>\n<br>\nSince we seem to be this ego whenever we are aware of anything other than ourself (that is, any forms or phenomena of any kind whatsoever), we cannot eradicate ego so long as we cling to awareness of anything else, and hence the only way to eradicate it is to cling to awareness of ourself alone, as he very clearly implies in <a href=\"#un25\">verse 25</a>. What then remains is only pure awareness, which is what we always actually are, and the nature of which is to be aware of nothing other than itself, as he implies, for example, in verses <a href=\"#un11\">11</a>, <a href=\"#un12\">12</a>, <a href=\"#un13\">13</a> and <a href=\"#un31\">31</a>. Therefore since everything else is just an illusory appearance that seems to exist only when we seem to be this ego, and since this ego will cease to exist only when we investigate it, the only truly worthwhile enterprise is for us to investigate who or what we actually are.<br>\n<br>\nWhat he teaches us in <i>Uḷḷadu Nāṟpadu</i> is supplemented and supported by what he teaches us <i>Nāṉ Yār?</i> and <i>Upadēśa Undiyār</i>, and also to a lesser extent in his other writings and in numerous answers that he gave to those who came to him seriously seeking the way to put an end to all suffering, deficiency and dissatisfaction, which have been recorded more or less accurately in various other books, but <i>Uḷḷadu Nāṟpadu</i> shines as the core and crest-jewel of his teachings, being the quintessence of all of them (which are in turn the quintessence of all <i>vēdānta</i> philosophy and of all that is metaphysically true in other philosophies, religions or systems of belief).<br>\n<br>\nAs in <i>Upadēśa Undiyār</i>, in <i>Uḷḷadu Nāṟpadu</i> Bhagavan expressed the fundamental principles of his teachings in the style of <i>sūtras</i> or aphorisms, so though each verse is relatively short, it is packed with deep meaning and is rich in implications, and hence they require explanation in order for us to understand and appreciate them more deeply and completely. However no explanation of them should be considered complete, because no matter how much we may study and reflect on their meaning, we can always find fresh depth of meaning and wealth of implications in them, and consequently our understanding of them can become more clear, as I often find while answering questions or replying to comments on this blog, because when I cite and apply these verses in different contexts my understanding of them is deepened and enriched.<br>\n<br>\nTherefore in this article, for each verse I have given a bare translation, which is as accurate, clear and simple as possible, followed by an explanatory paraphrase in order to make its meaning and most important implications more clear. Then instead of attempting to give any new explanations of these verses, after each one I have given a list of links in reverse chronological order to places in this blog where I have already cited, explained and discussed it. Later I intend to post a copy of this translation on my website, but until I do so I will try to keep the list of links for each verse up to date by adding new links as and when I write any further explanations of any of these verses.<br>\n<ol>\n<a href=\"#unp\"><i>Pāyiram</i>: introductory verse composed by Sri Muruganar</a><br>\n<a href=\"#unm1\"><i>Maṅgalam</i> verse 1: what exists is only thought-free awareness, which is called ‘heart’, so being as it is is alone meditating on it</a><br>\n<a href=\"#unm2\"><i>Maṅgalam</i> verse 2: by surrendering to God, who is devoid of death and birth, the ego, who fears death, will die, and what will remain is deathless</a>\n<li><a href=\"#un01\">Verse 1: because we see the world, it is best to accept that one fundamental, which is ourself, is what appears as all this multiplicity</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un02\">Verse 2: instead of the ego arguing whether there is just one fundamental or three fundamentals, standing in the real state of oneself by destroying the ego is best</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un03\">Verse 3: the state in which the ego has died by investigating itself, leaving aside the world and all differences and disputes, is agreeable to all</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un04\">Verse 4: if one perceives oneself as a form, one will perceive everything else as forms, but one’s real nature is infinite (hence formless) awareness, so it perceives no forms at all</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un05\">Verse 5: the body is a form consisting of five sheaths, and without such a body has anyone ever perceived any world?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un06\">Verse 6: the world consists of nothing but the five kinds of sense-impressions, and the mind alone perceives it, so is there any world besides the mind?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un07\">Verse 7: the world shines only by the mind, but what shines as the space for the appearing and disappearing of the world and mind is the real substance, the infinite whole</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un08\">Verse 8: worshipping in name and form is the way to see in name and form, but seeing oneself and thereby becoming one with the real substance is true seeing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un09\">Verse 9: dyads and triads depend on one thing (the ego), so if one sees within the mind what that one thing is, they will all cease to exist and what is real will be seen</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un10\">Verse 10: knowledge and ignorance of other things are mutually dependent, but only the awareness that knows the reality of the ego, to whom they appear, is real awareness</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un11\">Verse 11: knowing anything other than oneself is ignorance, but when one knows the reality of oneself, knowledge and ignorance of everything else will cease</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un12\">Verse 12: oneself is real awareness, which shines without anything else to know, so it is devoid of both knowledge and ignorance of other things, but it is not void or nothingness</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un13\">Verse 13: oneself, who is pure awareness, alone is real, so awareness of multiplicity is ignorance and unreal, and hence it does not exist except as oneself</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un14\">Verse 14: if one investigates the reality of the first person, it will cease to exist along with all second and third persons, and what then shines as one is one’s real nature</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un15\">Verse 15: past and future depend on the present, the only time that actually exists, so trying to know the past or future without knowing the reality of the present is like trying to calculate without knowing the value of one</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un16\">Verse 16: if we are a body, we are ensnared in time and place, but if we investigate ourself, there is no time or place but only ourself, who are the same one always and everywhere</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un17\">Verse 17: for those who do not know themself and for those who do, the body is ‘I’, but for the former ‘I’ is limited to the body, whereas for the latter ‘I’ shines without limit</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un18\">Verse 18: for those who do not know themself and for those who do, the world is real, but for the former reality is limited to the world, whereas for the latter it pervades without form as the substratum of the world</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un19\">Verse 19: dispute about which prevails, fate or will, arises only for those who do not discern the ego as the root of them both, but if one knows the reality of the ego, one will thereby discard them</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un20\">Verse 20: seeing God without seeing oneself is seeing a mental vision, so only one who has seen oneself, the origin of one’s ego, is one who has seen God, because oneself is not other than God</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un21\">Verse 21: since oneself is one, how is oneself to see oneself, and how to see God, except by becoming food to him?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un22\">Verse 22: how to know God, who shines within the mind illumining it, except by turning the mind back within and thereby immersing it in him?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un23\">Verse 23: this body is not aware of itself as ‘I’, and ‘I’ does not cease to exist in sleep, but after something called ‘I’ rises, everything rises, so keenly discern where it rises</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un24\">Verse 24: the <i>jaḍa</i> body is not aware of itself as ‘I’, and <i>sat-cit</i> does not rise, but in between something called ‘I’ rises as the extent of the body, and this is <i>cit-jaḍa-granthi</i>, the ego, mind and so on</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un25\">Verse 25: grasping form the formless phantom-ego comes into existence, stands, feeds itself and flourishes, but if it seeks itself, it will take flight</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un26\">Verse 26: if the ego comes into existence, everything comes into existence, and if it does not exist, nothing exists, so investigating what it is is giving up everything</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un27\">Verse 27: the state in which the ego does not rise is the state in which we are that, but without investigating the place where it rises, how can one annihilate it and stand as that?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un28\">Verse 28: like sinking to find something that has fallen in water, sinking within by a keenly focused mind it is necessary to know oneself, the source where the ego rises</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un29\">Verse 29: investigating by an inward sinking mind where one rises as ‘I’ alone is the path of <i>jñāna</i>, whereas thinking ‘I am not this, I am that’ is an aid but not <i>vicāra</i></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un30\">Verse 30: as soon as the ego dies by inwardly investigating who am I, one thing appears spontaneously as ‘I am I’, which is not the ego but the infinite substance, namely oneself</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un31\">Verse 31: when the ego is destroyed by <i>tanmayānanda</i>, there is nothing to do, because one is not aware of anything other than oneself, so who can conceive such a state?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un32\">Verse 32: when the Vēdas proclaim ‘That is you’, instead of knowing and being oneself by investigating what am I, thinking ‘I am that, not this’ is due to lack of strength</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un33\">Verse 33: saying ‘I do not know myself’ or ‘I have known myself’ is ridiculous, because there are not two selves for one to know the other as an object</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un34\">Verse 34: instead of merging the mind within and thereby knowing and standing firmly as the real substance, quarrelling about its existence and nature is mischief born of <i>māyā</i></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un35\">Verse 35: knowing and being the ever-accomplished real substance is the real <i>siddhi</i>, whereas all other <i>siddhis</i> are unreal, like <i>siddhis</i> experienced in a dream</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un36\">Verse 36: if we think that we are a body, thinking ‘No, we are that’ will be just a good aid, but since we are already that, why should we always be thinking ‘We are that’?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un37\">Verse 37: even the contention ‘Duality in spiritual practice, non-duality in attainment’ is not true, because even while one is searching for the tenth man, who is one other than him?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un38\">Verse 38: if we are the doer of action, we will experience the resulting fruit, but when one knows oneself by investigating who is the doer, actions and their fruits will cease to exist</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un39\">Verse 39: thoughts of bondage and liberation exist only so long as one seems to be bound, but when one looks at oneself to see who is bound, one will see that one is ever liberated</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#un40\">Verse 40: if it is said that liberation is with form, without form, or either with form or without form, I will reply that only destruction of the ego is liberation</a></li>\n</ol>\n<b>உள்ளது நாற்பது (<i>Uḷḷadu Nāṟpadu</i>): Forty Verses on What Is</b><br>\n<br>\n<a name=\"unp\"></a><b>பாயிரம் (<i>pāyiram</i>): Introductory Verse</b> (composed by Sri

href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2022/11/sri-arunacala-aksaramanamalai-verse-17.html#unm1\">Since our real nature (<i>ātma-svarūpa</i>) is beyond the reach of thought or word, meaning that it cannot be grasped by the mind or expressed in words, as Bhagavan implies here, ‘உள்ள பொருள் உள்ளல் அற உள்ளத்தே உள்ளதால்’ (<i>uḷḷa-poruḷ uḷḷal-aṟa uḷḷattē uḷḷadāl</i>), ‘Since the existing substance exists in the heart without thought’, it cannot be revealed by anything other than itself, and since it is the silence of pure being, it can reveal itself only in and through that silence</a><br>\n2022-07-02: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2022/07/sri-arunacala-aksaramanamalai-verse-8.html#unm1\">Since pure pure awareness (<i>uṇarvu</i> or <i>cit</i>), which alone is what actually exists (<i>uḷḷadu</i> or <i>sat</i>), alone is what we actually are, we can know ourself as we actually are only by just being as it is</a><br>\n2021-05-12: <a

href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2020/06/why-did-bhagavan-sometimes-say-heart-is.html#unm1\">When Bhagavan says, ‘உள்ளத்தே உள்ளபடி உள்ளதே உள்ளல்’ (<i>uḷḷattē uḷḷapaḍi uḷḷadē uḷḷal</i>), ‘Being in the heart as it is alone is thinking [or meditating on it]’, he means that we should be in and as உள்ள பொருள் (<i>uḷḷa-poruḷ</i>), the existing substance, which is our real nature, pure awareness</a><br>\n2019-12-21: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/12/self-investigation-is-only-means-by.html#unm1\">Bhagavan is not the body but pure awareness and infinite love, so he is always here and now, shining clearly in our heart as our fundamental awareness of our own existence, ‘I am’, and hence only by being in the heart as it is (<i>uḷḷattē uḷḷapaḍi uḷḷadē</i>) are we

(<i>upādhi</i>), and hence our awareness of ourself as ‘I am this body’ is what he describes in verse 24 as ‘உபாதி யுணர்வு’ (<i>upādhi-y-uṇarvu</i>), ‘adjunct-awareness’</a><br>\n2022-03-24: <a

href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2023/07/anma-viddai-verse-3-knowledge-of-all.html#un13a\">Though other things seem to exist when we are aware of them, they do not actually exist, so they are just an illusory appearance, and hence being aware of them is not real knowledge but only ignorance</a><br>\n2022-09-06: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2022/09/sri-arunacala-aksaramanamalai-verse-12.html#un13\">Though ego or mind, which is the false awareness that sees itself as numerous phenomena, is ignorance and unreal, both it and the many things that it sees itself as are all nothing other than the one real substance, namely <i>ātma-svarūpa</i>, ourself as we actually are, which is pure awareness, just as gold ornaments, though many and diverse in appearance, are all nothing other than gold, which is their one substance</a><br>\n2022-03-24: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2022/03/upadesa-sarah-sanskrit-text.html#un13\">The very nature of ego is <i>avidyā</i> or self-ignorance, because as ego we are always aware of ourself as ‘I am this body’ and consequently we are aware of the seeming existence of other things, and since nothing other than ourself actually exists, being aware of the appearance of other things is ignorance (<i>ajñāna</i>)</a><br>\n2022-03-10: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2022/03/sri-arunacala-aksaramanamalai-payiram.html#un13\">What is real is what actually exists, namely

href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2022/02/anma-viddai-verse-1-thought-is-what.html#un13\">What is மெய் (<i>mey</i>), real, is only ourself, because we alone are what actually exists, as he says in the first sentence of the seventh paragraph of <i>Nāṉ Ār?</i></a><br>\n2021-11-18: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2021/11/appala-pattu-appalam-song-tamil-text.html#un13\">As Bhagavan says in this verse, ‘ஞானம் ஆம் தானே மெய்’ (<i>ñāṉam ām tāṉē mey</i>), ‘Oneself, who is <i>jñāna</i> [pure awareness], alone is real’, so we alone are <i>sat</i>, and hence he often used to say that clinging firmly to ourself by being keenly self-attentive is the best <i>sat-saṅga</i></a><br>\n2021-06-29: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2021/06/the-nature-of-ego-and-its-visaya.html#un13\">மெய் (<i>mey</i>), ‘real’, means what actually exists, so ‘ஞானம் ஆம் தானே மெய்’ (<i>ñāṉam ām tāṉē mey</i>), ‘Oneself, who is <i>jñāna</i> [pure awareness], alone is real’, means that what actually exists is only our real nature, which is pure awareness, and hence other things do not actually exist even though they seem to exist</a><br>\n2021-03-22: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2021/03/the-second-and-third-paragraphs-of-nan.html#un13\">The distinction between transitive and intransitive awareness is one of the fundamental principles of Bhagavan’s teachings, and it is explained by him, albeit without using these terms, in verse 27 of <i>Upadēśa Undiyār</i> and verses 10, 11, 12, 13 of <i>Uḷḷadu Nāṟpadu</i></a><br>\n2021-02-02: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2021/02/in-what-sense-is-it-true-to-say.html#un13\">Here ‘real’ means what actually exists, whereas ‘unreal’ means what does not actually exist, even if it seems to exist, so the implication is that only one thing actually exists, and that one thing is what we actually are, namely pure awareness</a><br>\n2020-12-31: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2020/12/bhagavans-verses-on-birthday.html#un10-13\">What we actually are is just pure awareness, which means awareness that is not aware of anything other than itself, so only when we are aware of nothing other than ourself are we aware of ourself as we actually are</a><br>\n2020-12-18: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2020/12/if-everything-is-predestined-how-can.html#un13\">What is real is only ‘I am’, our fundamental awareness of our own existence (<i>sat-cit</i>), as Bhagavan clearly implies in the first sentence of this verse</a><br>\n2020-03-09: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2020/03/though-we-appear-in-two-distinct-modes.html#un13\"><i>Uḷḷadu

href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2020/02/there-are-many-interpretations-of.html#un13\">Being aware of anything other than ourself is <i>avidyā</i> (ignorance), as Bhagavan implies in the

nothing other than our real nature actually exists, it alone is real awareness, and being aware of anything else is being aware of what does not exist, so it is not real awareness but only ignorance</a><br>\n2019-10-25: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/10/can-we-as-ego-ever-experience-pure.html#un13\">What is real is only ourself, who are pure awareness

any multiplicity</a><br>\n2019-03-22: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/03/is-it-possible-to-have-direct-but.html#un13\">Knowing ourself is not a knowledge that can be either gained or lost, because it is what we always are, and it alone is real</a><br>\n2019-02-20: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/02/what-is-relationship-between-i-thought.html#un13\">Oneself, who is awareness, alone is real, so awareness of anything else is not real awareness but only ignorance</a><br>\n2019-01-31: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/01/to-understand-consciousness-can-we-rely.html#un13\">As Bhagavan explains in verses 10 to 13, awareness or knowledge of anything other than ourself is not real awareness or knowledge but only ignorance, because nothing other than ourself actually exists</a><br>\n2018-12-30: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2018/12/which-is-more-reasonable-and-useful.html#un13\">As ego we mistake awareness of phenomena to be knowledge, so we mistake the absence of such awareness in sleep to be ignorance, but as Bhagavan implies here, awareness of phenomena is ignorance, because real awareness is not aware of anything other than itself, and because phenomena are not real, since they do not exist independent of our perception of them</a><br>\n2018-11-08: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2018/11/everything-depends-for-its-seeming.html#un13\">Since nothing other than ourself actually exists, being aware of other things is not real awareness but only ignorance</a><br>\n2018-11-08: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2018/11/everything-depends-for-its-seeming.html#un13a\">Since awareness that is aware of other things is what is generally called ‘ego’ or ‘mind’, in this verse Bhagavan implies that ego is not real awareness but only ignorance, but what seems to be ego is nothing other than real awareness, because nothing else actually exists</a><br>\n2018-11-08: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2018/11/everything-depends-for-its-seeming.html#un13b\">So long as we are aware of anything other than ourself, as such we are not real awareness but only mind, but though mind is not real awareness, it is nothing other than real awareness, so when instead of being aware of anything else we are aware of ourself alone, we cease to be mind and remain as real awareness, which is what we always actually are</a><br>\n2018-01-04: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.co.uk/2018/01/in-what-sense-does-bhagavan-generally.html#un13\">Though Bhagavan sometimes uses physical analogies to distinguish substance from form, such as the analogy of gold and ornaments made of it, when he uses the terms <i>poruḷ</i> or <i>vastu</i> in the sense of ‘substance’, he is not referring to any kind of physical substance but only to metaphysical substance (the one real substance), which is pure awareness</a><br>\n2017-12-28: <a

Contemplate [investigate, discern, determine or ascertain] by <i>nuṇ mati</i> [a subtle, refined, sharp, keen, acute, precise, meticulous and discerning mind or intellect] where this ‘I’

23: only after ego rises does everything else rise, so with keen discernment investigate yourself, the source where ego rises</a><br>\n2021-06-29: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2021/06/the-nature-of-ego-and-its-visaya.html#uk23a\">The first sentence of this verse, ‘நான் என்று இத் தேகம் நவிலாது’ (<i>nāṉ eṉḏṟu i-d-dēham navilādu</i>), ‘This body does not say I’, is a metaphorical way of saying that it is not aware of itself as ‘I’, and Bhagavan explains this in the <i>kaliveṇbā</i> version by adding a clause, ‘மதியிலதால்’ (<i>mati-y-iladāl</i>), ‘Since it is not awareness’ or ‘Since it is devoid of awareness’</a><br>\n2021-06-29: <a

rises is explained by Bhagavan in the <i>kaliveṇbā</i> version of this verse, in which he extended the final sentence as: ‘இந்த நான் எங்கு எழும் என்று நுண் மதியால் எண்ண, நழுவும்’ (<i>inda nāṉ eṅgu eṙum eṉḏṟu nuṇ matiyāl eṇṇa, naṙuvum</i>), ‘When one contemplates by a subtle mind where this I rises, it slips away’</a><br>\n2020-11-01: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2020/11/we-can-practise-self-abidance-only-by.html#un23\">Being keenly self-attentive is what he describes here as investigating by ‘நுண் மதி’ (<i>nuṇ

to see what we actually are is our likes, dislikes, desires, attachments, hopes and fears for things other than ourself</a><br>\n2019-05-08: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/05/the-ultimate-truth-is-ajata-but-because.html#un23\">As Bhagavan says in this verse and verse 26, all other things come into existence only when we

23 and 24 of <i>Uḷḷadu Nāṟpadu</i> Bhagavan uses the noun ‘ஒன்று’ (<i>oṉḏṟu</i>), which means ‘one thing’ or ‘the one’, when referring to it</a><br>\n2019-01-29: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/01/how-to-be-self-attentive-even-while-we.html#un23\">In order to see what we actually are, we need to observe ourself with a very keen and acute power of discernment, as Bhagavan implied by using the terms ‘நுண் மதியால்’ (<i>nuṇ matiyāl</i>) in this verse and ‘கூர்ந்த மதியால்’ (<i>kūrnda matiyāl</i>) in verse 28</a><br>\n2018-11-08: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2018/11/everything-depends-for-its-seeming.html#un23a\">The body and everything else seem to exist only when ego, this one thing called ‘I’, seems to exist, because they seem to exist only in its view and not in the view of our real nature (<i>ātma-svarūpa</i>)</a><br>\n2018-11-08: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2018/11/everything-depends-for-its-seeming.html#un23b\">‘After one thing, I, rises, everything rises’ implies that the appearance of ego is causally antecedent to the appearance of everything else</a><br>\n2018-11-08: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2018/11/everything-depends-for-its-seeming.html#un23c\">In verses 23 and 26 Bhagavan says unequivocally that everything else comes into existence only after ego comes into existence, so we need to interpret what he says in verses 24 and 25 accordingly</a><br>\n2018-09-01: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2018/09/like-everything-else-karma-is-created.html#un23a\">The clarity, sharpness and subtlety of mind or intellect that Bhagavan refers to here as ‘நுண் மதி’ (<i>nuṇ mati</i>) is what the term ‘vivēka’ actually refers to, and it is the instrument that we must hone and use in order to be able to investigate ourself so keenly that we distinguish ourself clearly from everything else and thereby see what we actually are</a><br>\n2018-09-01: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2018/09/like-everything-else-karma-is-created.html#un23b\">We

than ego’s awareness of it, so its awareness of anything other than pure awareness is a thought, and since ego is that which is aware of itself as something other than pure awareness, it is itself a thought, but unlike all other thoughts, which are <i>jaḍa</i> (devoid of awareness) and therefore not aware of anything, ego is aware both of itself and all other things, because it is

unlike each of the other three functions, namely mind, intellect and will, it is not any of the five sheaths, but what grasps the body consisting of these five sheaths as ‘I am this body’, so since ‘I am’ is <i>sat-cit</i> (existence-awareness, namely our fundamental awareness of our own existence) whereas the body and all the five sheaths of which it is composed are <i>jaḍa</i>, ego is what is

nor <i>sat-cit</i>, which does not rise, but something that misappropriates certain properties of each: from <i>sat-cit</i> it borrows its substance, namely its existence (<i>sat</i>) and its

(existence-awareness or real awareness), which does not rise, but something that rises in between them as ‘I am this body’, so from <i>sat-cit</i> it borrows the property of being aware of itself as

he is using the verb ‘say’ in a metaphorical sense, because what he means is simply that the body is not aware of itself as ‘I’, since it is not aware, so he is not talking about the physical act of

will are both non-aware (<i>jaḍa</i>), so though intellect is ego’s ability to judge and distinguish one thing from another, and will consists of ego’s likes, dislikes, desires, attachments, hopes, fears and so on, neither of them is ego itself</a><br>\n2019-06-11: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/06/in-what-sense-and-to-what-extent-do-we.html#un24\"><i>Uḷḷadu Nāṟpadu</i>

grasping a body (in the sense of a form consisting of five sheaths, namely a physical body, life, mind intellect and will) as if it were itself, and it is a phantom because it has no substance of its own, so it could not seem to exist without borrowing its substance (its existence and its awareness) from the one real substance (<i>vastu</i> or <i>poruḷ</i>), namely pure existence-awareness (<i>sat-cit</i>), which is ourself as we actually are</a><br>\n2023-05-16: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2023/05/anma-viddai-verse-2-thought-i-am-this.html#un25\"><i>Uḷḷadu Nāṟpadu</i> verse 25: the nature of ourself as ego is to rise, stand and flourish to the extent that we attend to anything other than ourself, but to subside and dissolve back within to the extent that we attend to ourself alone</a><br>\n2022-11-09: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2022/11/sri-arunacala-aksaramanamalai-verse-16.html#un25\">The nature of ourself as ego is to be constantly ‘grasping form’, which means grasping things other than ourself, but if we as ego seek (investigate or attend to) ourself, we will ‘take flight’ or run away, meaning that we will subside and dissolve back into the source from which we rose, namely our own being, ‘I am’, which is Arunachala</a><br>\n2022-07-02: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2022/07/sri-arunacala-aksaramanamalai-verse-8.html#un25\">In verse 8 of <i>Śrī Aruṇācala Akṣaramaṇamālai</i> ‘உனை கண்டு’ (<i>uṉai kaṇḍu</i>), ‘seeing you’, does not mean seeing Arunachala in name and form because the nature of ego or mind is to rise, stand and flourish by attending to forms, but to subside and dissolve back into its source only by attending to itself</a><br>\n2022-06-17: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2022/06/sri-arunacala-aksaramanamalai-verse-7.html#un25\">Since we cannot rise, stand or flourish as ego without first grasping the form of a body as ourself and then grasping other forms as the objects of our experience, the very nature of ourself as ego or mind is to be always grasping forms of one kind or another, whether relatively gross or relatively subtle, so the only means by which we as ego can subside in such a way that we will never rise again is to cling firmly to ourself alone</a><br>\n2022-04-14: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2022/04/sri-arunacala-aksaramanamalai-verse-3.html#un25\">Not only do all other thoughts depend for their seeming existence upon ego, but ego depends for its seeming existence on other thoughts, because without grasping other thoughts it cannot rise, stand or flourish</a><br>\n2022-03-10: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2022/03/sri-arunacala-aksaramanamalai-payiram.html#un25\">The nature of ego is to live, endure and flourish by grasping things other than itself, but to

ego is a formless phantom, whatever forms it grasps are things other than itself, so what Bhagavan means by உரு (<i>uru</i>) or ‘form’ in this context is objects or phenomena, which are what are called <i>viṣayas</i> in Sanskrit, and which are all just thoughts</a><br>\n2022-02-08: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2022/02/anma-viddai-verse-1-thought-is-what.html#un25a\">So long as ego exists other thoughts will continue sprouting from it, because ego cannot rise or stand without grasping other thoughts, so without eradicating ego we cannot eradicate all other thoughts</a><br>\n2021-12-04: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2021/12/what-are-vasanas-and-how-do-they-work.html#un25\">The nature of ego is to always attend to things other than itself, which is what Bhagavan means here by ‘grasping form’, so as ego we tend to have strong inclinations to attend to other things, and since everything other than ourself is a <i>viṣaya</i> (an object or phenomenon), our inclinations to attend to such things are what he calls <i>viṣaya-vāsanās</i></a><br>\n2021-06-29: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2021/06/the-nature-of-ego-and-its-visaya.html#un25a\">Since ego cannot rise, stand or flourish without grasping things other than itself, it is the very nature of ego to have <i>viṣaya-vāsanās</i>, so we will not be completely free of <i>viṣaya-vāsanās</i> until ego is eradicated</a><br>\n2021-06-29: <a

that ego seems to exist only when it attends to anything other than itself, so it will cease to exist only by attending keenly and exclusively to itself alone</a><br>\n2021-05-17: <a

href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2020/12/bhagavans-verses-on-birthday.html#un25\">The nature of ego is such that we cannot rise, stand or flourish as ego except by ‘grasping form’, which means attending to things other than ourself, so if we turn back within to attend to ourself alone, ego ‘will take flight’, which means we will thereby subside and merge back into our source, the pure awareness ‘I am’, which is what we always actually are</a><br>\n2020-12-31: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2020/12/bhagavans-verses-on-birthday.html#un25b\">Since the nature of ego is to rise, stand and flourish by attending to anything other than itself, but to subside and dissolve back into its source by attending only to itself, the more carefully and lovingly we attend to ‘I am’, the more ego will subside and dissolve, until eventually it merges forever in and as its source, whereupon what will remain is only ‘I am’ shining in its pristine and eternal state as pure awareness</a><br>\n2020-12-31: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2020/12/bhagavans-verses-on-birthday.html#un25a\">Whenever we rise as ego we grasp the form of a body as ‘I’, and when we

‘உருவற்ற பேய் அகந்தை’ (<i>uru-v-aṯṟa pēy ahandai</i>), ‘formless phantom-ego’, what he means by saying it is formless (<i>uru-v-aṯṟa</i>) is that it has no form of its own, and what he means by saying

substance is mind, and the substance of mind is ego, so ego is ultimately the one substance of which all forms are made, as Bhagavan implies when he says ‘அகந்தையே யாவும் ஆம்’ (<i>ahandai-y-ē yāvum

it will cease to exist) when we attend to ourself keenly enough, and since everything else (all other thoughts, namely all forms, objects or phenomena) seems to exist only in the view of ourself as

href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/12/self-investigation-is-only-means-by.html#c8930389603198326220\">Second of a series of two comments explaining that Bhagavan is not the body or mind that he seemed to be but only pure awareness, so he was not aware of anything other than himself, because in the absence of ego there is nothing to know other than oneself</a><br>\n2020-01-03: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/12/self-investigation-is-only-means-by.html#c6267473292313091493\">Comment explaining why Bhagavan says ‘Therefore when the world appears, <i>svarūpa</i> does not appear; when <i>svarūpa</i> appears (shines), the world does not appear’ in the fourth paragraph of <i>Nāṉ Ār?</i></a><br>\n2019-12-21: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/12/self-investigation-is-only-means-by.html#un26\">We cannot surrender ourself entirely without investigating what we actually are</a><br>\n2019-12-16: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/12/what-we-need-to-investigate-is-not-act.html#c28657417618124544\">Comment explaining that ego is everything in the sense that it is the sole substance that appears as all phenomena, but when it sees itself as a constantly changing stream of phenomena, what changes or is modulated is not ego itself but only the forms in which it sees itself</a><br>\n2019-12-15: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/12/why-do-we-need-to-distinguish-ourself.html#un26\">Though Bhagavan said, ‘அகந்தையே யாவும் ஆம்’ (<i>ahandaiyē yāvum ām</i>), ‘Ego alone is everything’, this does not mean that we cannot and should not distinguish ego from all phenomena, because ego is the formless substance, whereas all phenomena are mere forms whose sole substance is ego, so ego is distinct from phenomena in the same sense that gold is distinct from whatever ornaments are formed from it</a><br>\n2019-12-10: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/12/why-should-we-try-to-be-aware-of.html#un26\">Everything other than ourself seems to exist only in the clouded view of ourself as ego and not in the clear view of ourself as we actually are, so in order to be aware of ourself as we actually are we need to be aware of ourself alone, in complete isolation from awareness of anything else</a><br>\n2019-11-08: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/11/ego-seems-to-exist-only-when-we-look.html#un26\">None of the other things that ego looks at exist prior to or independent of it, because they are created by its perception of them</a><br>\n2019-11-08: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/11/ego-seems-to-exist-only-when-we-look.html#un26a\">Everything else comes into existence only when ego comes into existence, so when ego does not exist nothing else exists, and hence ego is the first cause, the cause of all other causes, so no cause could exist prior to our rising as ego</a><br>\n2019-10-16: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/10/is-it-possible-for-us-to-attend-to.html#c6938871392694430818\">Comment explaining that nothing exists in sleep other than our real nature, which is <i>sat-cit-ānanda</i>, so the only difference between sleep (<i>manōlaya</i>) and eradication of ego (<i>manōnāśa</i>) is that ego will never rise again from the latter, whereas it does rise from the former, but this in not a difference in those states but only a difference from the perspective of ourself as ego in waking or dream</a><br>\n2019-10-07: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/10/is-it-possible-for-us-to-attend-to.html#un26\">Everything (all phenomena or objects) appears only from ego, and ego appears only from pure awareness, which is our real nature, so the immediate source and substance of everything is ego, and the ultimate source and substance of everything is pure awareness</a><br>\n2019-09-14: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/08/is-any-external-help-required-for-us-to.html#c6934619475578257110\">Comment explaining that the world cannot appear after ego has been eradicated, because ‘if ego does not exist, everything does not exist’</a><br>\n2019-08-15: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/08/the-role-of-grace-in-all-that-ego.html#c2852263070004581861\">Comment explaining that the practice of self-investigation (<i>ātma-vicāra</i>) is clinging firmly to oneself, which means being keenly self-attentive, and the practice of self-surrender is letting go of everything other than oneself, which entails attending to nothing other than oneself, so self-investigation and self-surrender are inseparable</a><br>\n2019-08-05: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/08/the-role-of-grace-in-all-that-ego.html#un26b\">Since we as ego create and sustain the appearance of everything else, if by being keenly self-attentive we surrender ourself entirely to the infinite love of Bhagavan, which is our own real nature (<i>ātma-svarūpa</i>), we thereby give up not only ego but also everything else</a><br>\n2019-08-05: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/08/the-role-of-grace-in-all-that-ego.html#un26a\">Though Bhagavan does not explicitly say in <i>Uḷḷadu Nāṟpadu</i> that our present world is just a dream, he clearly implies this in many of its verses, such as this one</a><br>\n2019-07-30: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/07/which-comes-first-ego-or-self.html#un26\">Everything other than ego seems to exist only because we have risen as ego, so ego is the first cause: the cause of all other causes</a><br>\n2019-05-30: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/05/how-can-we-refine-and-sharpen-our-power.html#un26\">The keen and subtle intellect (<i>kūrnda mati</i> or <i>nuṇ mati</i>) that we require in order to discern what we actually are can be cultivated only by self-investigation (<i>ātma-vicāra</i>), for which we need to be willing to give up being aware of anything else</a><br>\n2019-05-08: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/05/the-ultimate-truth-is-ajata-but-because.html#un26\">What misperceives <i>brahman</i> as all these phenomena is only ego, so the appearance of any illusion is entirely dependent on the appearance of ourself as ego</a><br>\n2019-05-08: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/05/the-ultimate-truth-is-ajata-but-because.html#un26a\">Everything perceived is just an illusory appearance (<i>vivarta</i>), like everything perceived in a dream, so it is brought into seeming existence only by the perceiver’s perception of it, and the perceiver of everything is only ourself as ego</a><br>\n2019-05-08: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/05/the-ultimate-truth-is-ajata-but-because.html#un26b\">In verse 7 of <i>Śrī Aruṇācala Aṣṭakam</i> Bhagavan says, ‘இன்று அகம் எனும் நினைவு எனில், பிற ஒன்றும் இன்று’ <i>iṉḏṟu aham eṉum niṉaivu eṉil, piṟa oṉḏṟum iṉḏṟu</i>), ‘If the thought called I does not exist, even one other [thought or thing] will not exist’, which is exactly the same teaching that he gave us in the second sentence of this verse</a><br>\n2019-03-25: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/03/is-it-possible-to-have-direct-but.html#c2116128168386250280\">Comment explaining that all phenomena cease to exist when ego ceases to exist</a><br>\n2019-03-23: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/02/what-is-relationship-between-i-thought.html#c5313625928956645473\">Comment explaining that the seeming existence of all other things depends on the seeming existence of ourself as ego</a><br>\n2019-03-22: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/03/is-it-possible-to-have-direct-but.html#un26\"><i>Uḷḷadu Nāṟpadu</i> verse 26: if we investigate ego keenly enough, it will cease to exist, and everything else will cease to exist along with it</a><br>\n2019-03-22: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/03/is-it-possible-to-have-direct-but.html#un26a\">So long as we are aware of phenomena, we must be present as ego, because what experiences phenomena is not ourself as we actually are but only ourself as ego</a><br>\n2019-03-22: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/03/is-it-possible-to-have-direct-but.html#un26b\">The appearance of phenomena entails the fundamental duality of subject and objects, perceiver and things perceived, because all phenomena are objects of perception, and the subject who perceives them is only ego, so ego and phenomena co-exist</a><br>\n2019-02-15: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2019/02/thoughts-and-dreams-appear-only-in-self.html#un26\">Thoughts and dreams appear only in the view of ourself as ego, so as long as any thoughts or dreams appear we have not ceased to rise as ego</a><br>\n2018-12-30: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2018/12/which-is-more-reasonable-and-useful.html#un26a\">Since ego, the false awareness ‘I am this body’, does not exist in sleep, nothing other than our real nature (<i>ātma-svarūpa</i>) exists there, not even the <i>ānandamaya kōśa</i> or ‘causal body’ (<i>kāraṇa śarīra</i>)</a><br>\n2018-12-30: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2018/12/which-is-more-reasonable-and-useful.html#un26\">Whenever ego rises, it rises with its will or causal body, which is what is called <i>ānandamaya kōśa</i>, and from which it instantaneously projects the other four <i>kōśas</i>, through which it in turn projects all other phenomena, so as Bhagavan says, ‘அகந்தையே யாவும் ஆம்’ (<i>ahandaiyē yāvum ām</i>), ‘Ego itself is everything’</a><br>\n2018-11-08: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2018/11/everything-depends-for-its-seeming.html#un26\"><i>Uḷḷadu Nāṟpadu</i> verse 26: everything is ego, the false awareness ‘I am this body’</a><br>\n2018-11-08: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2018/11/everything-depends-for-its-seeming.html#un26a-b1\">As in many other verses of <i>Uḷḷadu Nāṟpadu</i>, in this verse Bhagavan clearly implies that the appearance of ego is causally antecedent to the appearance of everything else</a><br>\n2018-11-08: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2018/11/everything-depends-for-its-seeming.html#un26a-b2\">Though it is only in and by the presence of our real nature that everything else seems to exist, it is not in the view of our real nature that other things seem to exist but only in the view of ourself as ego</a><br>\n2018-11-08: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2018/11/everything-depends-for-its-seeming.html#un26a-b3\">In verses 23 and 26 Bhagavan says unequivocally that everything else comes into existence only after ego comes into existence, and they do not exist when ego does not exist, so we need to interpret what he says in verses 24 and 25 accordingly</a><br>\n2018-11-08: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2018/11/everything-depends-for-its-seeming.html#un26a-b4\">Neither ego nor anything else other than our real nature actually exists, so their existence is not actual existence but only seeming existence</a><br>\n2018-11-08: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2018/11/everything-depends-for-its-seeming.html#un26c\">Ego itself is everything in the sense that it is the seed that expands as everything else, so what it projects and perceives as so many phenomena is nothing but itself, and hence it is the one substance that appears as all forms</a><br>\n2018-11-08: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2018/11/everything-depends-for-its-seeming.html#un26d1\">What is aware of everything else is only ego, so if we investigate ourself keenly enough to be aware of ourself as we actually are, we will thereby give up being aware of anything else</a><br>\n2018-11-08: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2018/11/everything-depends-for-its-seeming.html#un26d2\">When ego ceases to exist everything else will cease to exist along with it, so in the fourth and final sentence of this verse he says: ‘Therefore, know that investigating what this [ego] is alone is giving up everything’</a><br>\n2018-09-01: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2018/09/like-everything-else-karma-is-created.html#un26a\">Our ultimate aim is to give up everything, including its root, the ego, which we can do only by investigating what this ego is</a><br>\n2018-09-01: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2018/09/like-everything-else-karma-is-created.html#un26\">Since ego does not exist in sleep, nothing else exists there</a><br>\n2018-09-01: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2018/09/like-everything-else-karma-is-created.html#un26b\">Bhagavan introduced one extremely important clarification that is not stated so explicitly elsewhere, whether in the <i>upaniṣads</i> or in any other ancient <i>advaita</i> texts, namely that the original cause of all phenomena is only ego, so ‘if ego comes into existence, everything comes into existence’, and ‘if ego does not exist, everything does not exist’</a><br>\n2018-05-13: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2018/05/the-ego-is-sole-cause-creator-source.html#un26\"><i>Uḷḷadu Nāṟpadu</i> verse 26: everything depends for its seeming existence on the seeming existence of the ego, so when we investigate the ego keenly enough to see that it does not exist, that is giving up everything</a> (this section contains an explanation of the significance and importance of the <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2017/12/upadesa-kalivenba-extended-version-of.html#uk26\"><i>kaliveṇbā</i> extension to this verse</a>, namely கருவாம்

<i>prārabdha</i>) actually is, we will thereby know our real nature, and hence ego will be eradicated and all its three <i>karmas</i> (<i>āgāmya</i>, <i>saṁcita</i> and <i>prārabdha</i>) will cease to exist</a><br>\n2020-12-08: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2020/11/how-can-we-weaken-and-eventually.html#c1067616492711997089\">To the extent that we attend to ourself and thereby refrain from attending to whatever happens according to <i>prārabdha</i>, we will not be affected by it, and if we attend to ourself keenly enough, we will eradicate ego and thereby destroy all the three <i>karmas</i></a><br>\n2020-10-27: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2020/10/doership-sleep-and-practice-of-self.html#un38\">Doership is the very nature of ego, because as ego we experience all the five sheaths as ourself, and hence the actions of those five sheaths as actions done by us, so doership will not disappear entirely until ego is eradicated</a><br>\n2019-05-27: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2018/09/like-everything-else-karma-is-created.html?commentPage=4#c933158976738861735\">Comment explaining that ego is both the doer of actions and the experiencer of their fruit, but will cease to exist along with all its three <i>karmas</i> if we investigate ourself keenly enough to see what we actually are</a><br>\n2018-09-01: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2018/09/like-everything-else-karma-is-created.html#un38\">If we want to free ourself entirely from the entangled and tightly binding web of <i>karma</i> we must patiently and persistently persevere in practising self-investigation, and we must give up the mistaken belief that we can act without a sense of doership before eradicating ego, which is what Bhagavan refers to in this verse as வினைமுதல் (<i>viṉai-mudal</i>), the doer and root of all actions</a><br>\n2018-09-01: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2018/09/like-everything-else-karma-is-created.html#un38a\">We are the doer of whatever actions we do by our will, so we alone are responsible for them, which is why Bhagavan said in the first sentence of this verse: ‘வினைமுதல் நாம் ஆயின், விளை பயன் துய்ப்போம்’ (<i>viṉaimudal nām āyiṉ, viḷai payaṉ tuyppōm</i>), ‘If we are the doer of action, we will experience the resulting fruit’</a><br>\n2018-09-01: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2018/09/like-everything-else-karma-is-created.html#un38b\">Bhagavan refers to ego as ‘வினைமுதல்’ (<i>viṉaimudal</i>), which in grammar means the subject, doer or agent of an active verb, and therefore in this context means the doer of action, but which is a compound formed of two words, namely வினை (<i>viṉai</i>), which means action or <i>karma</i>, and முதல் (<i>mudal</i>), which means beginning, origin, cause, base or foundation, so it is a term that clearly expresses the role of the doer as the initiator, origin, cause and foundation of all action or <i>karma</i></a><br>\n2018-04-18: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2018/04/the-ego-does-not-actually-exist-but-it.html#un38\">When the sense of doership (the ego) is eradicated, all action (<i>karma</i>) will cease to

though Bhagavan does not accept that any action ever actually happens, he does concede that they seem to happen and that we seem to be the doer of them, because in our view this seems to be the case</a><br>\n2017-07-27: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2017/07/any-experience-that-is-temporary-is-not.html#un38\"><i>Uḷḷadu Nāṟpadu</i> verse 38: if we investigate it keenly

explaining that so long as we experience ourself as this ego, we will seem to be the thinker of all thoughts (the doer of all mental actions) and hence the doer of whatever bodily or vocal actions result from our thinking, so we cannot relinquish our sense of doership without annihilating our ego</a><br>\n2016-04-17: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2016/03/why-is-it-necessary-to-make-effort-to.html#c1606160794930933440\">Comment explaining that the way to free ourself from all forms of <i>karma</i> is only to try to be self-attentive as much as possible, because self-attentiveness alone will dissolve the primal illusion that we are this ego, the doer of actions and the experiencer of their fruits</a><br>\n2016-02-08: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2016/02/why-should-we-believe-what-bhagavan.html#un38\"><i>Uḷḷadu Nāṟpadu</i> verse 38: <i>karma</i> exists only for the ego</a><br>\n2014-09-12: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2014/09/why-did-sri-ramana-teach-karma-theory.html#un38\">We need not investigate <i>karma</i> in any great depth or detail, but should focus all our effort and attention only on investigating the ‘I’ that feels ‘I am doing <i>karma</i>’ or ‘I am experiencing the fruit of <i>karma</i>’</a><br>\n2011-01-21: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2011/01/how-to-avoid-creating-fresh-karma.html#un38\">By trying to be self-attentive we will not alter what the mind is destined to experience, but will remove the illusion that we are this experiencing mind</a><br>\n2009-06-14: <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2009/06/ulladu-narpadu-explanatory-paraphrase.html#un38\"><i>Uḷḷadu
