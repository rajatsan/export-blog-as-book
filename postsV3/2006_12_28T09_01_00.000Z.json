    "title": "What is <i>advaita</i>?",
    "content": "As a conclusion to my previous post, <a href=\"http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2006/12/is-there-really-any-difference-between.html\" target=\"_blank\">Is there really any difference between the <i>advaita</i> taught by Sri Ramana and that taught by Sri Adi Sankara?</a>, I would like to add the following simple definition of <i>advaita</i>.<br>\n<br>\nIn brief, we can define <i>advaita</i> simply as self-attention &mdash; the state in which we are attentive to or conscious of only our own self, our true and essential being, 'I am', and not any other thing. Atention to anything other than ourself is duality or <i>dvaita</i>, and cannot be the real state of absolute non-duality or <i>advaita</i>.<br>\n<br>\nIn other words, as I wrote in the comment that I added to the <a href=\"http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2006/12/is-there-really-any-difference-between.html\" target=\"_blank\">previous post</a>, true <i>advaita</i> or non-duality can in fact be experienced only in the state of perfect self-attention or self-consciousness.",
