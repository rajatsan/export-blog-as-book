    "content": "Yesterday I posted on my website at <a href=\"http://www.happinessofbeing.com/resources/happiness_art_being.html\">www.happinessofbeing.com/resources/happiness_art_being.html</a> a revised and enlarged second e-book edition of <a href=\"http://www.happinessofbeing.com/resources/happiness_art_being.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Happiness and the Art of Being</em></a>.<br /><br />Since I published the first e-book edition on 15th December 2006 I have revised it thoroughly, making many small amendments and incorporating a considerable number of additional explanations, together with translations of several more passages from the original Tamil writings of Sri Ramana.<br /><br />Though I have incorporated the equivalent of about 80 pages of new material in this second e-book edition, the actual number of pages has increased only by about 32 pages, up to more than 570 pages, because the software that I have used to create the PDF file of this edition has produced a more compact but still very readable font, thereby ensuring that the printed version of this book will be a somewhat less massive volume.<br /><a name='more'></a><br />Since the beginning of February I have posted in this blog most of the major additions that I have now incorporated in this second e-book edition. I have not incorporated any major addition in the introduction, in chapter 1, 'What is Happiness?', or in chapter 7, 'The Illusion of Time and Space', but the following is a list of most of the major additions or modifications that I have incorporated in the other eight chapters. For each addition, I have listed the page numbers at which it now appears in the new edition, a link to the article in this blog in which I posted it (if I did do so), and finally in brackets the page number of the location in the first edition in which I incorporated it.<br /><br /><strong>Chapter 2, 'Who am I?':</strong><br /><ul><li>111-112: <a href=\"http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2007/03/consciousness-that-we-experience-in.html\">The consciousness that we experience in sleep</a> (119)</li><li>119-125: <a href=\"http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2007/02/our-imaginary-sleep-of-self.html\">Our imaginary sleep of self-forgetfulness or self-ignorance</a> (127)</li><li>125-129: <a href=\"http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2007/02/are-we-in-this-world-or-is-this-world.html\">Are we in this world, or is this world in us?</a> (127 continued)</li><li>129-135: <a href=\"http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2007/02/our-waking-life-is-just-another-dream.html\">Our waking life is just another dream</a> (127 continued)</li><li>135-140: <a href=\"http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2007/02/only-absolute-clarity-of-true-self.html\">Only the absolute clarity of true self-knowledge will put an end to all our dreams</a>(127 continued)</li><li>140-141: <a href=\"http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2007/02/our-self-consciousness-is-absolute.html\">Our self-consciousness is the absolute reality</a> (127 continued)</li><li>152-154: <a href=\"http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2007/02/our-real-i-is-formless-and-therefore.html\">Our real 'I' is formless and therefore unlimited</a> (137)</li><li>161-165: <a href=\"http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2007/02/our-body-mind-and-other-adjuncts-are.html\">Our body, mind and other adjuncts are not 'I'</a> (145-146)</li></ul><p><strong>Chapter 3, 'The Nature of Our Mind':</strong></p><ul><li>173: One paragraph has been expanded into two paragraphs (153)</li><li>173-179: <a href=\"http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2007/02/foundation-of-all-our-thoughts-is-our.html\">The foundation of all our thoughts is our primal imagination that we are a body</a> (154)</li><li>190-191: One paragraph has been amended and expanded into two paragraphs (166)</li><li>206-211: <a href=\"http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2007/03/while-revising-happiness-and-art-of.html\">Everything is only our own consciousness</a> (182)</li><li>219-220: <a href=\"http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2007/03/contemplating-i-which-is-original-name.html\">Contemplating 'I', which is the original name of God</a> (190)</li><li>234-235: <a href=\"http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2007/03/by-self-attentiveness-we-can-experience.html\">By self-attentiveness we can experience our true self-consciousness unadulterated by our mind</a> (206)</li></ul><p><strong>Chapter 4, 'The Nature of Reality':</strong></p><ul><li>246-247, 266-267, 271 and 284: <a href=\"http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2007/03/nature-of-reality-additions-to-chapter.html\">The Nature of Reality - additions to chapter 4 of <em>Happiness and the Art of Being</em></a> (219, 240-241, 244 and 258-259)</li></ul><strong>Chapter 5, 'What is True Knowledge?':</strong><br /><ul><li>302-306: <a href=\"http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2007/03/objective-knowledge-will-disappear.html\">Objective knowledge will disappear along with our mind when we know ourself as we really are</a> (277)</li><li>307-311: <a href=\"http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2007/03/non-duality-is-truth-even-when-duality.html\">Non-duality is the truth even when duality appears to exist</a> (278)</li><li>311-313: <a href=\"http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2007/03/everything-is-just-expansion-of-our-own.html\">Everything is just an expansion of our own mind or ego</a> (279-280)</li><li>324-325 and 327-328: <a href=\"http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2007/03/what-is-true-knowledge-additions-to.html\">What is True Knowledge?
