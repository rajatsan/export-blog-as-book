    "title": "Who has attained 'self-realisation'?",
    "content": "At the end of the same message that I referred to in my previous post, <a href=\"http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2006/12/putting-it-all-together.html\" target=\"_blank\">'Putting it all together'</a>, the person who wrote it added the following question:<br /><br /><blockquote>You will probably not answer me, but I'll ask anyway... have you attained Self-Realization, Enlightenment through your contact and knowledge? </blockquote>In my reply I wrote as follows:<br /><br />Regarding your question about whether I have attained 'self-realisation' or 'enlightenment', the simple answer is that as an individual person I have certainly not attained anything. However, as spiritual aspirants our aim is not to attain 'self-realisation' as a person, but is to discover that we are not the person that we now imagine ourself to be, but are only the eternal and infinite real self, which is absolute being-consciousness, and which always knows nothing other than itself.<br /><a name='more'></a><br />The person that we now mistake ourself to be can never attain 'self-realisation' or 'enlightenment'. All we as a person can do is to turn our attention within, towards our own essential consciousness of being, 'I am', and thereby to drown and dissolve our mind or false individual consciousness in the perfect clarity of true self-consciousness. In other words, 'self-realisation' is not a state that can be attained by any person, but is the absolute clarity of true knowledge in which we as a person cease to exist.<br /><br />True self-knowledge is the absolutely non-dual experience of pure uncontaminated self-consciousness, in which there is no room for the rising of any thought such as 'I have attained this self-knowledge', or for any person or mind that could think such a thought.<br /><br />The question whether a certain person has attained 'self-realisation' is truly both meaningless and useless. The idea or belief that a certain person has attained 'self-realisation' is just a thought, and hence it is a product of our self-ignorance — a concept or imagination that bears no relation to the reality. Moreover, why should we be concerned about the spiritual state of any other person? Our only aim should be to know our own reality, and when we know that, we will discover that 'self-realisation' or perfect self-consciousness is what we really are, and is not something this is other than us.<br /><br />Since we ourself are true self-knowledge, why should we imagine that we see that self-knowledge in any other person? We can experience self-knowledge only in ourself, and we can never find it or truly know it in any other person.",
