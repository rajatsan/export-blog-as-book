    "title": "Consciousness and time",
    "content": "With reference to the coming new year, someone remarked that like consciousness time has no divisions to mark its passage, meaning that all divisions of time, such as weeks, months, years and centuries, are entirely arbitrary and mind-made. However, though the implied meaning of this remark is true in general, the specific comparison of time with consciousness is not so apt.<br><br>The one crucial division or dividing point in time is the present moment, which is experienced by us as present due to the presence of our own consciousness. We always experience consciousness as being here and now, so our consciousness is what defines both the present place and the present moment.<br><br>So long as we experience ourself as being the object-knowing consciousness that we call 'mind', our consciousness does appear to be divided or interrupted by sleep and by the separation between waking and dream. However, underlying this transitory object-knowing consciousness, which appears in waking and dream and disappears in sleep, we also experience a more subtle form of consciousness, namely our consciousness of our own being, 'I am', which is permanent, undivided and non-dual.<br><a name='more'></a><br>This non-dual and indivisible consciousness of our own being is our true consciousness — indeed it is our true self, our essential being, what we really are. It is always present, in all our three states, waking, dream and sleep, and in all the three divisions of time, past, present and future, and it is what lends reality to all that we experience in these three transitory states and in the passing of time. Without this fundamental consciousness 'I am', we could not experience or be conscious of any other thing.<br><br>Our mind, which experiences the passing of time and our three states, is a transient and ever-changing form of consciousness that appears in and is supported by our fundamental consciousness of just being. Since it is a phenomenon that we experience only at certain times and in certain states, and that vanishes at other times and in other states, such as sleep, swoon, coma or death, this mind cannot be our real self.<br><br>We cannot be anything that we experience only temporarily. Since the only thing that we experience permanently, even in sleep and other such states in which our mind has disappeared, is our consciousness of our own being, 'I am', it alone can be our real self.<br><br>Therefore, if we wish to know our real self, which is the one enduring reality that underlies the ephemeral appearance of our mind and everything that we know through the medium of our mind, we must turn our attention away from our mind, its thoughts and all the other objects that it knows, and must focus it keenly upon our mere non-dual consciousness of being — our essential self-consciousness 'I am'. Only by means of such self-attentiveness can we experience our real self, our essential being, which is the one absolute reality that underlies the appearance of all other things, which are only relatively real.<br><br>This simple practice of self-attentiveness is the path of <i>atma-vichara</i>, 'self-enquiry' or self-investigation, which Sri Ramana taught us as the only means by which we can experience the perfect peace and joy that is our own true nature, our own real being.",
