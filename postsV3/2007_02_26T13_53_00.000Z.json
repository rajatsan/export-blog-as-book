    "title": "<i>Happiness and the Art of Being</i> â€” final revision is now in progress",
    "content": "As I wrote in an earlier post, <a href=\"http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2007/02/i-apologise-if-i-have-not-replied-to.html\">I apologise if I have not replied to any e-mail that you might have sent me</a>, for the past one month I have had only intermittent access to the internet and to my e-mail, and I expect my access to continue being irregular for some time to come.<br /><br />Before today, the last time I had access to the internet was eight days ago, and that was only for a few hours, so there are many e-mails that I have received during the past two weeks to which I have not yet had an opportunity to reply. Therefore if you have written to me during the last two weeks and have not yet received a reply from me, please accept my apologies. I will reply to all the e-mails that I have received as and when I have opportunity to do so.<br /><br />However, the good news is that while I have not had access to the internet, I have been making good progress on the final revision of <a href=\"http://www.happinessofbeing.com/resources/happiness_art_being.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Happiness and the Art of Being</em></a> in preparation for its forthcoming publication as a printed book, and while doing so, I have added several new explanations.<br /><a name='more'></a><br />I have already posted all the new explanations that I have added in chapter 2, 'Who am I?', in the following six posts of this <a href=\"http://www.happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/\">discussion forum</a>:<br /><ul><li><a href=\"http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2007/02/our-imaginary-sleep-of-self.html\">Our imaginary sleep of self-forgetfulness or self-ignorance</a></li><li><a href=\"http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2007/02/are-we-in-this-world-or-is-this-world.html\">Are we in this world, or is this world in us?</a></li><li><a href=\"http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2007/02/our-waking-life-is-just-another-dream.html\">Our waking life is just another dream</a></li><li><a href=\"http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2007/02/only-absolute-clarity-of-true-self.html\">Only the absolute clarity of true self-knowledge will put an end to all our dreams</a></li><li><a href=\"http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2007/02/our-self-consciousness-is-absolute.html\">Our self-consciousness is the absolute reality</a></li><li><a href=\"http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2007/02/our-body-mind-and-other-adjuncts-are.html\">Our body, mind and other adjuncts are not 'I'</a></li></ul><p>As and when I have access to the internet, I will continue posting in this <a href=\"http://www.happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/\">discussion forum</a> the other additional explanations that I have been writing for inclusion in <a href=\"http://www.happinessofbeing.com/resources/happiness_art_being.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Happiness and the Art of Being</em></a>.</p><p>Because many people have written to me saying that they would like to have a printed copy of <a href=\"http://www.happinessofbeing.com/resources/happiness_art_being.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Happiness and the Art of Being</em></a>, I obviously have to give priority to this work of revising it, and since the new explanations that I am writing (some of which are intended to answer some of the many questions that I have been receiving since I first posted <a href=\"http://www.happinessofbeing.com/resources/happiness_art_being.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Happiness and the Art of Being</em></a> as an e-book on my main website, <a href=\"http://www.happinessofbeing.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.happinessofbeing.com</a>, in the middle of last December) may interest many people, I will continue giving priority to posting them in this <a href=\"http://www.happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/\">discussion forum</a>.</p><p>However, while doing so, I will also try to reply to the now large backlog of e-mails that I have been receiving. Therefore please bear with me if you have to wait for a reply to any e-mail that you may have sent me.</p><p>When I have finished my present revision of <a href=\"http://www.happinessofbeing.com/resources/happiness_art_being.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Happiness and the Art of Being</em></a>, and before it is published as a printed book, I will replace the present e-book version, which is available at <a href=\"http://www.happinessofbeing.com/resources/happiness_art_being.html\" target=\"_blank\">www.happinessofbeing.com/resources/happiness_art_being.html</a>, with the revised version. </p>",
