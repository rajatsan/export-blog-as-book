    "title": "<i>Happiness and the Art of Being</i> - release of the Indian edition",
    "content": "Earlier today the first copies of the Indian edition of <a href=\"http://www.happinessofbeing.com/happiness_art_being.html\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Happiness and the Art of Being</i></a> were offered at the feet of Bhagavan Sri Ramana at his shrine in <a href=\"http://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Sri Ramanasramam</a>, Tiruvannamalai, and it has now been released for sale in <a href=\"http://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Sri Ramanasramam</a> Book Stall.<br /><br />On Monday I also received a bound proof copy of the <a href=\"http://www.trafford.com/4dcgi/notification-form?item=20190&amp;20712940-17700aaa\" target=\"_blank\">Trafford edition</a> from the publishers in Canada, but unfortunately it contained a few minor errors, which they are now correcting. As soon as they have corrected these errors they will send me a revised e-proof, so I hope that they will be able to release it for sale on their <a href=\"http://www.trafford.com/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> at <a href=\"http://www.trafford.com/07-0799\" target=\"_blank\">www.trafford.com/07-0799</a> by the end of this week or early next week. As soon as it is released, I will announce it here in this blog and on my main website, <a href=\"http://www.happinessofbeing.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.happinessofbeing.com</a>.",
