    "content": "<a name=\"av2\"></a>I have recently been trying to complete a detailed explanation about the song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnw6ACy-wqrza8a71OCbMDmK_f798rL8O\"><i>Āṉma-Viddai</i></a> that I began to write more than two years ago but never had time to complete, so if it is Bhagavan’s will I hope to be able to post that here within the next few weeks. In the meanwhile, since the teaching ‘நான் நான்’ (<i>nāṉ nāṉ</i>) or ‘अहम् अहम्’ (<i>aham aham</i>), ‘I am I’, is such a fundamental and central principle of his teachings, but one that is sadly so overlooked and neglected due to a widespread misinterpretation of it and a consequent failure to recognise its profound significance, I decided to post this extract from the explanation I have written for <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2016/10/i-am-is-reality-i-am-this-or-i-am-that.html#av2\">verse 2</a> of <i>Āṉma-Viddai</i>:<br><a name='more'></a>\n<blockquote>ஊனா ருடலிதுவே நானா மெனுநினைவே<br>\nநானா நினைவுகள்சே ரோர்நா ரெனுமதனா<br>\nனானா ரிடமெதென்றுட் போனா னினைவுகள்போய்<br>\nநானா னெனக்குகையுட் டானாய்த் திகழுமான்ம — <br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ஞானமே; இதுவே மோனமே; ஏக வானமே;<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;இன்பத் தானமே.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ஐயே)<br>\n<br>\n<i>ūṉā ruḍaliduvē nāṉā meṉuniṉaivē<br>\nnāṉā niṉaivugaḷsē rōrnā reṉumadaṉā<br>\nṉāṉā riḍamedeṉḏṟuṭ pōṉā ṉiṉaivugaḷpōy<br>\nnāṉā ṉeṉakkuhaiyuṭ ṭāṉāyt tikaṙumāṉma —<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ñāṉamē; iduvē mōṉamē; ēka vāṉamē;<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iṉbat tāṉamē</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>aiyē</i>)<br>\n<br>\n<b>பதச்சேதம்:</b> ‘ஊன் ஆர் உடல் இதுவே நான் ஆம்’ எனும் நினைவே நானா நினைவுகள் சேர் ஓர் நார் எனும் அதனால், ‘நான் ஆர் இடம் எது?’ [அல்லது, ‘நான் ஆர்? இடம் எது?’] என்று உள் போனால், நினைவுகள் போய், ‘நான் நான்’ என குகை உள் தானாய் திகழும் ஆன்ம ஞானமே. இதுவே மோனமே, ஏக வானமே, இன்ப தானமே.

If we go within investigating the source from which we have spread out, ego and all other thoughts will cease, and <i>ātma-jñāna</i> will shine spontaneously as ‘I am I’</b><br>\n<br>\nIf we go within by keenly investigating ourself, the source from which we have spread out as ego, and the ground that underlies and supports the appearance of ourself as ego, the thought ‘I am this body’ (namely ego), which is the first thought and the root of all other thoughts, will cease to exist, and hence all other thoughts will cease along with it, and what will then remain shining is only pure self-awareness (<i>ātma-jñāna</i>), which is always aware of itself as it actually is, namely as ‘I am only I’, as Bhagavan implies in the main clause of this first sentence: “நான் ஆர் இடம் எது என்று உள் போனால், நினைவுகள் போய், ‘நான் நான்’ என குகை உள் தானாய் திகழும் ஆன்ம ஞானமே” (<i>nāṉ ār iḍam edu eṉḏṟu uḷ pōṉāl, niṉaivugaḷ pōy, ‘nāṉ nāṉ’ eṉa guhai uḷ tāṉāy tikaṙum āṉma-ñāṉamē</i>), “if one goes within [investigating] what is the place from which I spread out, thoughts will cease, and in the cave <i>ātma-jñāna</i> alone will shine spontaneously as ‘I am I’”.<br>\n<br>\nHere குகை (<i>guhai</i>), ‘cave’, is a metaphor for the heart, the innermost core of our being, and ‘ஆன்ம ஞானம்’ (<i>āṉma-ñāṉam</i>) is a Tamil form of the Sanskrit term ‘आत्म ज्ञान’ (<i>ātma-jñāna</i>), which means self-knowledge or self-awareness in the sense of the pure adjunct-free awareness of our own existence, ‘I am’. Though <i>ātma-jñāna</i> is always clearly shining within us as ‘I am’, in the view of ourself as ego it seems to be obscured, because instead of being aware of ourself as just ‘I am’, we are now aware of ourself as ‘I am this body’. In other words, though we always know <i>that I am</i>, we do not know <i>what I am</i>, which means that we know our existence but not our real identity.<br>\n<br>\nWhether we know our real identity or not, we always know our own existence as ‘I am’, so what we now need to know is our real identity, because only when we know our real identity (that is, when we know ourself as we actually are) will this false identification ‘I am this body’ be eradicated. This is why we need to investigate what we actually are, because only by investigating ourself can we know ourself as we actually are.<br>\n<br>\nWhat we actually are is only ourself and nothing else, so our real identity is only ‘I am I’ and not ‘I am this’ or ‘I am that’. As Bhagavan often explained, what is aware of itself as ‘I am this’ or ‘I am that’ is only ego, whereas our real nature is always aware of itself just as ‘I am I’. This is why he says in this sentence that if we sink deep within by investigating ourself, thought will cease (thereby implying that the primal thought ‘I am this body’ will cease to exist along with all other thoughts) and <i>ātma-jñāna</i> will shine forth within the cave of our heart as ‘I am I’ (that is, as awareness of ourself as ourself alone).<br>\n<br>\n<a name=\"identity\"></a><b>2. Our real identity is not ‘I am this’ or ‘I am that’ but only ‘I am I’, so though statements such as ‘I am <i>brahman</i>’ are useful as preliminary teachings, the ultimate teaching about our real identity is just ‘I am I’</b><br>\n<br>\nThis fact that our real identity is not ‘I am this’ or ‘I am that’ but only ‘I am I’ is one of the fundamental and most important principles of his teachings, but unfortunately it has been obscured in most English books on his teachings, because in such books the statements ‘நான் நான்’ (<i>nāṉ nāṉ</i>) and ‘अहम् अहम्’ (<i>aham aham</i>), both of which mean ‘I am I’, have in most cases been misinterpreted and wrongly translated as ‘I-I’, which does not convey any clear meaning at all. As far as I am aware the only English book that was published in Bhagavan’s bodily lifetime in which ‘நான் நான்’ (<i>nāṉ nāṉ</i>) or ‘अहम् अहम्’ (<i>aham aham</i>) was correctly interpreted as ‘I am I’ is <a href=\"http://www.holybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/Maha-Yoga-or-the-Upanishadic-Lore.pdf\"><i>Maha Yoga</i></a>, in the ninth chapter of which (2002 edition, page 150) Lakshmana Sarma wrote:<br>\n<blockquote>the mind becomes reduced to the state of pure Consciousness and begins to shine steadily in its pure form, as the formless ‘I’; the Sage calls this formless Consciousness the ‘I am I’ to distinguish it from the ego-sense which has the form of ‘I am this (body)’;</blockquote>\nIn a sentence such as ‘A is B’, A is the subject, ‘is’ is a copula and B is the subject complement, and in such a sentence in English a copula is generally required, but in many languages, including Tamil and Sanskrit, the copula in such a sentence is not required (a linguistic feature known as ‘zero copula’), because it is implied by the presence of a subject and complement with no verb, so in a sentence such as ‘A B’ the copula would be understood. For example, ‘நான் இது’ (<i>nāṉ idu</i>) means ‘I am this’, ‘நான் அது’ (<i>nāṉ adu</i>) means ‘I am that’, and ‘நானார்?’ (<i>nāṉ ār?</i>) means ‘I am who?’, even though there is no explicit copula (no verb that means ‘am’) in any of these sentences, because it is implicit in each of them. Likewise, ‘நான் நான்’ (<i>nāṉ nāṉ</i>) means ‘I am I’, because the copula is implicit in all such sentences.<br>\n<br>\nThe reason why Bhagavan often referred to the Biblical statement in which God reveals his real identity by saying ‘I am that I am’ (<i>Exodus</i> 3.13) is that ‘I am I’ is what he took this statement to mean (the exact meaning of the original Hebrew is not entirely clear, so it can be and has been interpreted in a variety of different ways, but one possible interpretation of it is ‘I am is what I am’, ‘I am is who I am’ or ‘I am, that is what I am’, which implies the same as ‘I am I’, and the aptness of this interpretation is confirmed by the next sentence, in which God tells Moses to say ‘I am has sent me to you’). This is why he sometimes said that this Biblical statement is the greatest of all the <i>mahāvākyas</i> (great statements that proclaim our real identity), thereby implying that it is a more apt expression of our real identity than any of the four <i>mahāvākyas</i> of the Vedas, namely ‘प्रज्ञानं ब्रह्म’ (<i>prajñānaṁ brahma</i>), ‘pure awareness is <i>brahman</i>’ (<i>Aitareya Upaniṣad</i> 3.3), ‘अयम् आत्मा ब्रह्म’ (<i>ayam ātmā brahma</i>), ‘this self is <i>brahman</i>’ (<i>Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad</i> 2), ‘तत् त्वम् असि’ (<i>tat tvam asi</i>), ‘that you are’ (<i>Chāndōgya Upaniṣad</i> 6.8.7), and ‘अहं ब्रह्मास्मि’ (<i>ahaṁ brahmāsmi</i>), ‘I am <i>brahman</i>’ (<i>Br̥hadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</i> 1.4.10).<br>\n<br>\nSo long as we are looking for something called <i>brahman</i> or God outside ourself, we need to be told that <i>brahman</i> or God is nothing other than ourself, because then only will we stop looking outside and instead turn our attention back within to investigate ourself alone, so this is the purpose and aim of each of the four <i>mahāvākyas</i> of the Vedas. However, we need to be reminded that we are <i>brahman</i> only so long as we still have a tendency to think of <i>brahman</i> as anything other than ourself. Once we have understood and are firmly convinced that we are <i>brahman</i>, we will understand that since the word ‘<i>brahman</i>’ refers to nothing other than ‘I’, the implication of statements such as ‘I am <i>brahman</i>’ is just ‘I am I’.<br>\n<br>\n<a name=\"un36\"></a>That is, the word ‘<i>brahman</i>’ becomes redundant once we truly understand that it means nothing other than ‘I’, because ‘I’ is the most direct and natural way for us to refer to ourself. Why should we continue to think or talk about <i>brahman</i> once we have understood that there is no such thing as <i>brahman</i> other than ‘I’? If we are not yet sufficiently convinced that we are <i>brahman</i>, it may be helpful to remind ourself that we are <i>brahman</i> or that <i>brahman</i> is ourself, but once we are firmly convinced that <i>brahman</i> is nothing other than ‘I’, we will stop thinking about <i>brahman</i> as if it were anything other than ourself and will instead try to attend only to ‘I’.<br>\n<br>\nAs Bhagavan says in <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2017/10/ulladu-narpadu-tamil-text.html#un36\">verse 36</a> of <i>Uḷḷadu Nāṟpadu</i>:<br>\n<blockquote>நாமுடலென் றெண்ணினல நாமதுவென் றெண்ணுமது<br>\nநாமதுவா நிற்பதற்கு நற்றுணையே — யாமென்று<br>\nநாமதுவென் றெண்ணுவதே னான்மனித னென்றெணுமோ<br>\nநாமதுவா நிற்குமத னால்.<br>\n<br>\n<i>nāmuḍaleṉ ḏṟeṇṇiṉala nāmaduveṉ ḏṟeṇṇumadu<br>\nnāmaduvā niṟpadaṟku naṯṟuṇaiyē — yāmeṉḏṟu<br>\nnāmaduveṉ ḏṟeṇṇuvadē ṉāṉmaṉida ṉeṉḏṟeṇumō<br>\nnāmaduvā niṟkumada ṉāl</i>.<br>\n<br>\n<b>பதச்சேதம்:</b> நாம் உடல் என்று எண்ணின், ‘அலம், நாம் அது’ என்று எண்ணும் அது நாம் அதுவா நிற்பதற்கு நல் துணையே ஆம். என்றும் ‘நாம் அது’ என்று எண்ணுவது ஏன்? ‘நான் மனிதன்’ என்று எணுமோ? நாம் அதுவா நிற்கும் அதனால்.<br>\n<br>\n<b><i>Padacchēdam</i></b> (word-separation): <i>nām uḍal eṉḏṟu eṇṇiṉ, ‘alam, nām adu’ eṉḏṟu eṇṇum adu nām adu-v-ā niṟpadaṟku nal tuṇai-y-ē ām. eṉḏṟum ‘nām adu’ eṉḏṟu eṇṇuvadu ēṉ? ‘nāṉ maṉidaṉ’ eṉḏṟu eṇumō? nām adu-v-ā niṟkum adaṉāl</i>.<br>\n<br>\n<b>அன்வயம்:</b> நாம் உடல் என்று எண்ணின், ‘அலம், நாம் அது’ என்று எண்ணும் அது நாம் அதுவா நிற்பதற்கு நல் துணையே ஆம். என்றும் நாம் அதுவா நிற்கும் அதனால், ‘நாம் அது’ என்று எண்ணுவது ஏன்? ‘நான் மனிதன்’ என்று எணுமோ?<br>\n<br>\n<b><i>Anvayam</i></b> (words rearranged in natural prose order): <i>nām uḍal eṉḏṟu eṇṇiṉ, ‘alam, nām adu’ eṉḏṟu eṇṇum adu nām adu-v-ā niṟpadaṟku nal tuṇai-y-ē ām. eṉḏṟum nām adu-v-ā niṟkum adaṉāl, ‘nām adu’ eṉḏṟu eṇṇuvadu ēṉ? ‘nāṉ maṉidaṉ’ eṉḏṟu eṇumō?</i><br>\n<br>\n<b>English translation:</b> If we think that we are a body, thinking ‘No, we are that’ will be just a good aid for us to stand as that.

Does one think ‘I am a man’ [that is, does one need to always think ‘I am a man’ in order to be aware of oneself as a man]? [Therefore instead of just thinking ‘I am not this body, I am that’, we should look keenly at ourself to see what we actually are, because only when we see what we actually are will we see that we always stand firmly as that.]</blockquote>\nIf we think that we are a donkey or a monkey, it may be helpful to remind ourself, ‘No, I am neither a donkey nor a monkey, I am a human being’, but if we know that we are human, there is no need for us to think ‘I am human’. Likewise, if we think we are anything other than <i>brahman</i>, it may be helpful for us to remind ourself, ‘No, I am only <i>brahman</i> and not anything else’, but once we have understood that we are nothing other than <i>brahman</i> and that <i>brahman</i> is nothing other than ourself, there is no need for us to think ‘I am <i>brahman</i>’.<br>\n<br>\nIndeed, there is no need for us to think about anything other than ‘I’, so even the thought or idea of <i>brahman</i> becomes redundant, because in our understanding it has been correctly and effectively replaced by ‘I’. If we want to think about <i>brahman</i>, all we need do is to attend only to ‘I’. Attending to anything other than ‘I’, even to the thought of <i>brahman</i>, is not meditating on <i>brahman</i> but on something else, because there is no <i>brahman</i> other than ‘I’.<br>\n<br>\nSo long as we rise as ego, we are consequently aware of ourself as ‘I am this body’ and are also aware of the seeming existence of things other than ‘I’, so we are not aware of ourself as we actually are, namely as that which alone exists, and hence we are not aware of <i>brahman</i> as it is, namely as ourself alone. Therefore for us <i>brahman</i> is just an idea, just one thought among many other thoughts, so if we think ‘I am <i>brahman</i>’ we are identifying ourself with a mere idea and not with <i>brahman</i> as it actually is, because we do not know <i>brahman</i> as it actually is.<br>\n<br>\nWhen we are aware of ourself as we actually are, we will not be aware of ourself as ‘I am <i>brahman</i>’ but only as ‘I am I’ (in other words, we will be aware of ourself as ourself alone), because it will then be clear to us that nothing other than ourself actually exists, so there is no such thing as <i>brahman</i> other than ‘I’. Therefore though statements such as ‘I am <i>brahman</i>’ are useful as preliminary teachings, the ultimate teaching about our real identity is not ‘I am <i>brahman</i>’ but just ‘I am I’, because what we actually are is nothing other than ‘I’.<br>\n<br>\n<a name=\"practical\"></a><b>3. Not only is ‘I am I’ the ultimate teaching about our real identity, but it is also the most practical teaching, because to keep our attention fixed firmly on ourself alone we should not think that we are anything other than ‘I’</b><br>\n<br>\nNot only is ‘I am I’ the ultimate teaching about our real identity, but it is also the most practical teaching, because once we have clearly understood that we are nothing other than ‘I’, we will have no inclination to think about or investigate anything else. So long as we think ‘I am <i>brahman</i>’, our attention is liable to be diverted away from ourself towards the idea of <i>brahman</i>, so to keep our attention fixed firmly on ourself alone we should not think that we are anything other than ‘I’.<br>\n<br>\nThis is why Bhagavan used the statement ‘நான் நான்’ (<i>nāṉ nāṉ</i>) or ‘अहम् अहम्’ (<i>aham aham</i>), ‘I am I’, so frequently to point out what we actually are, and why we can conclude without the least shadow of doubt that this is indeed the <i>Ramaṇa mahāvākya</i>: the great statement (<i>mahāvākya</i>) by which he proclaimed our real identity, and which lies at the very heart of his teachings and pervades all of them, in many cases explicitly and in other cases implicitly. That is, the reason he emphasised this <i>mahāvākya</i>, ‘I am I’, rather than any other <i>mahāvākya</i> such as ‘अहं ब्रह्मास्मि’ (<i>ahaṁ brahmāsmi</i>), ‘I am <i>brahman</i>’, or any equivalent such as ‘शिवोऽहम्’ (<i>śivō’ham</i>), ‘I am Siva’, or ‘सोऽहम्’ (<i>sō’ham</i>), ‘I am he’, is that the principal and ultimate aim of all his teachings is that we should focus our entire attention only on ‘I’ and not allow ourself to be distracted by anything else, not even by the thought of <i>brahman</i> or God, because what <i>brahman</i> or God actually is is nothing other than ‘I’, and still more importantly, what we ourself actually are is nothing other than ‘I’. Since nothing other than ‘I’ is real, and since we ourself are nothing other than ‘I’, we can know what is real and what we actually are only by attending to ‘I’ and not by attending to anything else whatsoever, so he never tired of reminding us that what we are is only ‘I’: ‘நான் நான்’ (<i>nāṉ nāṉ</i>), ‘अहम् अहम्’ (<i>aham aham</i>), ‘I am I’.<br>\n<br>\n<a name=\"brahman\"></a><b>4.

It is <i>poruḷ-pūṉḏṟam</i> [the entire substance, whole reality or <i>pūrṇa-vastu</i>, which is eternal and unchanging], the <i>poruḷ</i> [substance or <i>vastu</i>] that is oneself.</blockquote>\nThe first clause of this verse, ‘நான் ஆர் என மனம் உள் நாடி உளம் நண்ணவே’ (<i>nāṉ ār eṉa maṉam uḷ nāḍi uḷam naṇṇavē</i>), ‘As soon as the mind reaches the heart inwardly investigating who am I’, implies that when we investigate ourself keenly enough and thereby turn the full 180 degrees back towards ourself and hence away from everything else, the mind will sink into the innermost depth of our being and merge there in the heart, the fundamental awareness ‘I am’, which is the source from which it rose. The next clause, ‘நான் ஆம் அவன் தலை நாணம் உற’ (<i>nāṉ ām avaṉ talai nāṇam uṟa</i>), literally means ‘when he who is ‘I’ suffers head-shame’ but is a colloquial way of saying ‘when he who is ‘I’ dies’, thereby implying that ego will die as soon as it reaches the heart by inwardly investigating who am I. The main clause of this first sentence is the third one, ‘நான் நான் ஆ தோன்றும் ஒன்று தானாக’ (<i>nāṉ nāṉ ā tōṉḏṟum oṉḏṟu tāṉāha</i>), “one thing appears spontaneously as ‘I am I’”, in which ஒன்று (<i>oṉḏṟu</i>) is a noun that means ‘one’, so it can mean either ‘one thing’ or ‘the one’, implying the one thing that is actually real, and தானாக (<i>tāṉāha</i>) can mean either ‘spontaneously’ or ‘as oneself’.<br>\n<br>\nThough he says that one thing appears spontaneously as ‘I am I’, in the next sentence he adds, ‘தோன்றினும், நான் அன்று’ (<i>tōṉḏṟiṉum, nāṉ aṉḏṟu</i>), ‘Though it appears, it is not I’, thereby implying that it is not ego, which is the ‘I’ that appears in waking and dream and disappears in sleep. So if it is not this appearing and disappearing ‘I’, what is it? He answers this in the third and final sentence, ‘பொருள் பூன்றம் அது, தான் ஆம் பொருள்’ (<i>poruḷ-pūṉḏṟam adu, tāṉ ām poruḷ</i>), ‘It is <i>poruḷ-pūṉḏṟam</i> [the whole substance or <i>pūrṇa-vastu</i>], the substance that is oneself’.<br>\n<br>\n<a name=\"un07\"></a>The nature of the one real substance (<i>poruḷ</i> or <i>vastu</i>), which is the infinite whole (<i>pūṉḏṟam</i> or <i>pūrṇa</i>), is explained by him in the second sentence of <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2017/10/ulladu-narpadu-tamil-text.html#un07\">verse 7</a> of <i>Uḷḷadu Nāṟpadu</i>: ‘உலகு அறிவு தோன்றி மறைதற்கு இடன் ஆய் தோன்றி மறையாது ஒளிரும் பூன்றம் ஆம் அஃதே பொருள்’ (<i>ulahu aṟivu tōṉḏṟi maṟaidaṟku iḍaṉ-āy tōṉḏṟi maṟaiyādu oḷirum pūṉḏṟam ām aḵdē poruḷ</i>), ‘Only that which shines without appearing or disappearing as the place [space, expanse, location, site or ground] for the appearing and disappearing of the world and awareness [the awareness that perceives the world, namely ego or mind] is <i>poruḷ</i> [the real substance or <i>vastu</i>], which is <i>pūṉḏṟam</i> [the infinite whole or <i>pūrṇa</i>]’. Since the பூன்றம் ஆம் பொருள் (<i>pūṉḏṟam ām poruḷ</i>), ‘the substance, which is the whole’, shines without appearing or disappearing, why does he say in verse 30 that it appears spontaneously as ‘I am I’?<br>\n<br>\nIt does not actually appear, but so long as we rise as ego, from the perspective of ourself as ego our real identity, namely ‘I am I’, seems to be obscured by the false awareness ‘I am this body’, so when we investigate ourself keenly enough and thereby see ourself as we actually are, our real identity ‘I am I’ seems to appear anew, but as soon as it appears it ceases to seem new, because we recognise it to be our eternal and ever undiminished awareness of ourself as ourself alone. In other words, what momentarily appeared as if it were a new and fresh clarity of self-awareness (<a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/search/label/aha%E1%B9%81-sphura%E1%B9%87a\"><i>sphuraṇa</i></a>) is instantly recognised to be what is natural (<i>sahaja</i>), being what we always actually are.<br>\n<br>\n<a name=\"recognition\"></a><b>6.

The Sanskrit term <a href=\"https://sanskritdictionary.com/?q=sphuraṇa\">स्फुरण</a> (<i>sphuraṇa</i>) and its Tamil equivalent ஸ்புரிப்பு (<i>sphurippu</i>) are both nouns derived from the Sanskrit verb <a href=\"https://sanskritdictionary.com/?q=sphur\">स्फुर्</a> (<i>sphur</i>), which means to shine, be clear, be evident or make itself known in any way, and which is particularly used in the sense of shine forth, shine with a fresh clarity or appear afresh, and it is in this sense that he uses it in <a href=\"#us20\">verse 20</a> of <i>Upadēśa Sāram</i> when he says ‘अहम् अहंतया स्फुरति हृत् स्वयम्’ (<i>aham ahaṁtayā sphurati hṛt svayaṁ</i>), “the heart shines forth spontaneously as ‘I am I’”.<br>\n<br>\nThe Tamil form of स्फुर् (<i>sphur</i>) is <a href=\"https://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/tamil-lex_query.py?qs=ஸ்புரி&searchhws=yes\">ஸ்புரி</a> (<i>sphuri</i>) or more commonly <a href=\"https://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/tamil-lex_query.py?qs=புரி&searchhws=yes\">புரி</a> (<i>puri</i>), which means to shine, manifest, be clear, strike one’s mind or be understood. For example, to say ‘I understand’ in Tamil one would say ‘எனக்குப் புரியும்’ (<i>eṉakku-p puriyum</i>), meaning ‘it is clear to me’. Therefore he uses the nouns स्फुरण (<i>sphuraṇa</i>) and ஸ்புரிப்பு (<i>sphurippu</i>) to refer to the shining forth or fresh clarity of self-awareness.<br>\n<br>\nSince there are different degrees of clarity, he uses these terms to refer both to the partial degrees of clarity that we experience from the time we begin to practise self-investigation and to the full clarity that shines forth when ego is finally annihilated, so whenever he uses the terms <i>sphuraṇa</i> or <i>sphurippu</i> we need to understand from the context whether he is referring to partial or full clarity of self-awareness, and likewise when he uses the verbs <i>sphur</i> or <i>sphuri</i> we need to understand from the context whether he is referring to a partial shining forth or to the full and final shining forth of ourself as ‘I am I’. Even when he is referring only to a partial degree of clarity experienced during practice, he says that it shines forth as ‘I am I’ (meaning that it shines forth as awareness of ourself as ourself alone), because to the extent to which we attend to ourself it becomes clear to us that we are nothing other than ourself, the fundamental awareness that always shines within us as ‘I’.<br>\n<br>\nThe reason he uses terms such as <i>sphuraṇa</i>, <i>sphurippu</i> and ‘I am I’ to refer both to the partial degree of clarity that we experience to the extent to which we go deep in the practice of being self-attentive and to the infinite clarity that shines forth when ego is annihilated is that the clear recognition ‘I am I’ (recognition of ourself as ourself alone) is both the path and the goal, the means and the end. The deeper we go in the practice of self-investigation, the more clearly we recognise that we are nothing other than ourself, ‘I am just I’, and when this recognition becomes perfectly clear, that is awareness of ourself as we actually are, so ego, the false awareness ‘I am this body’, is thereby eradicated forever.<br>\n<br>\n<a name=\"un30a\"></a><a name=\"uu20a\"></a><a name=\"us20b\"></a><a name=\"uu21\"></a>As soon as it is eradicated, what seemed till then to be a new and fresh clarity of self-awareness (<i>sphuraṇa</i>), which had been gradually growing clearer until it finally swallowed us entirely in its all-consuming effulgence, is recognised to be natural (<i>sahaja</i>), being what Bhagavan calls ‘பொருள் பூன்றம்’ (<i>poruḷ-pūṉḏṟam</i>), ‘the whole substance’ or <i>pūrṇa-vastu</i>, and ‘தான் ஆம் பொருள்’ (<i>tāṉ ām poruḷ</i>), ‘the substance that is oneself’ or <i>ātma-vastu</i>, in <a href=\"#un30\">verse 30</a> of <i>Uḷḷadu Nāṟpadu</i>, ‘பூன்றம்’ (<i>pūṉḏṟam</i>), ‘the whole’, in <a href=\"#uu20\">verse 20</a> of <i>Upadēśa Undiyār</i> and ‘परम पूर्ण सत्’ (<i>parama pūrṇa sat</i>), ‘the supreme whole existence [being or reality]’, in <a href=\"#us20\">verse 20</a> of <i>Upadēśa Sāram</i>, so it is what we always actually are, as he clearly implies in <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2017/09/upadesa-undiyar-tamil-text.html#uu21\">verse 21</a> of <i>Upadēśa Undiyār</i>:<br>\n<blockquote>நானெனுஞ் சொற்பொரு ளாமது நாளுமே<br>\nநானற்ற தூக்கத்து முந்தீபற<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;நமதின்மை நீக்கத்தா லுந்தீபற.<br>\n<br>\n<i>nāṉeṉuñ coṯporu ḷāmadu nāḷumē<br>\nnāṉaṯṟa tūkkattu mundīpaṟa<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;namadiṉmai nīkkattā lundīpaṟa</i>.<br>\n<br>\n<b>பதச்சேதம்:</b> நான் எனும் சொல் பொருள் ஆம் அது நாளுமே, நான் அற்ற தூக்கத்தும் நமது இன்மை நீக்கத்தால்.<br>\n<br>\n<b><i>Padacchēdam</i></b> (word-separation): <i>nāṉ eṉum sol poruḷ ām adu nāḷumē, nāṉ aṯṟa tūkkattum namadu iṉmai nīkkattāl</i>.<br>\n<br>\n<b>அன்வயம்:</b> நான் அற்ற தூக்கத்தும் நமது இன்மை நீக்கத்தால், நான் எனும் சொல் பொருள் நாளுமே அது ஆம்.<br>\n<br>\n<b><i>Anvayam</i></b> (words rearranged in natural prose order): <i>nāṉ aṯṟa tūkkattum namadu iṉmai nīkkattāl, nāṉ eṉum sol poruḷ nāḷumē adu ām</i>.<br>\n<br>\n<b>English translation:</b> That is at all times the substance of the word called ‘I’, because of the exclusion of our non-existence even in sleep, which is devoid of ‘I’.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Explanatory paraphrase:</b> That [the one that appears as ‘I am I’, namely pure awareness, which is our real nature] is at all times the substance [or true import] of the word called ‘I’, because of the exclusion of our non-existence [that is, because we do not become non-existent] even in sleep, which is devoid of ‘I’ [namely ego].</blockquote>\nWe are always clearly aware of ourself as ‘I’, not only in waking and dream, when we rise and stand as ego, the false awareness ‘I am this body’, but also in sleep, when we remain just as ‘I am’ without rising as ‘I am this’ or ‘I am that’, so what we actually are is only the pure adjunct-free awareness ‘I’. Therefore, since we are never anything other than ‘I’, the clear awareness of ourself as ‘I am I’ (in other words, awareness of ourself as ourself alone) is always the true import of the word ‘I’.

If one considers why that is, since activities such as going do not exist separately but only in association with a body, it appears to be saying, does it not, that the body itself is ‘I’. But since the body did not exist before being born, since it is composed of the five elements, since it does not exist in sleep, and since it will depart as a corpse, is it appropriate to speak of it as the awareness ‘I’? It is not appropriate. The awareness that rises as ‘I’ referring to the body in this way, being intermediate [appearing as a link between real awareness and the body, being distinct from both but partaking of the nature of each of them], alone is what is called variously as <i>tat-bōdham</i> [a term that literally means ‘awareness of that’ but that is often used in the sense of egotism, which is awareness of oneself as a particular thing, distinct from all other things], <i>ahaṁkāra</i> [ego], <i>avidyā</i> [ignorance], <i>māyā</i> [the power of self-deception or delusion, namely the mind], <i>malam</i> [impurity] and <i>jīva</i> [soul]. Is it proper [for us] to remain without investigating about this? For investigating [that is, for prompting and encouraging us to investigate this false awareness that rises as ‘I’ mistaking itself to be a body], is it not, all <i>śāstras</i> [spiritual texts] have come into existence and proclaimed that annihilation of that <i>tat-bōdham</i> alone is <i>mukti</i> [liberation]. How to investigate? If one asks, [the reply is:] does this body, which is <i>jaḍa</i> [non-aware] like a block of wood, come shining and behaving as ‘I’? It does not come [as ‘I’]. Therefore, making the corpse-body remain as a corpse, and being without uttering ‘I’ even by word [or speech, whether physically or mentally], if one keenly investigates what it is that now shines as ‘I’, then in [one’s] heart a kind of <i>sphurippu</i> [a fresh clarity] alone will appear itself to itself [oneself to oneself] without sound as ‘I am I’ [that is, as awareness of oneself as oneself alone]. Without leaving [abandoning or letting go of] that [the fresh clarity that shines as ‘I am I’], if one just is, it will completely annihilate the <i>jīva-bōdha</i> [sense of individuality] in the form of <i>ahaṁkāra</i> [ego], which is called [or is aware of itself as] ‘the body is I’, and [then], like fire that catches on camphor, it will itself also be extinguished. This alone is said by sages and sacred texts to be <i>mōkṣa</i> [liberation].</blockquote>\nAs he explains here, if we keenly investigate what it is that shines as ‘I’, we will experience a <i>sphurippu</i> (<i>sphuraṇa</i>) or fresh clarity of self-awareness as ‘I am I’ (in other words, a fresh clarity of awareness of ourself as ourself alone), and we should then try to hold on to that <i>sphurippu</i> without letting go of it, because if we do so it will thoroughly annihilate ego, the false awareness ‘I am this body’.<br>\n<br>\n<a name=\"ny05\"></a><b>8. <i>Nāṉ Ār?</i> paragraph 5: thinking ‘I, I’ or ‘I am I’ can help us to become familiar with being self-attentive, but in order to sink deep within ourself we need to stop thinking even such thoughts</b><br>\n<br>\nIn this context some people ask whether he was referring to this practice of firmly holding the <i>sphuraṇa</i> ‘I am I’ when he wrote in the <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.com/nan_yar.html#para05\">fifth paragraph</a> of <i>Nāṉ Ār?</i>, ‘நான், நான் என்று கருதிக்கொண்டிருந்தாலுங்கூட அவ்விடத்திற் கொண்டுபோய் விட்டுவிடும்’ (<i>nāṉ, nāṉ eṉḏṟu karudi-k-koṇḍirundāluṅ-gūḍa a-vv-iḍattil koṇḍu-pōy viṭṭu-viḍum</i>), “Even if one continues thinking ‘I, I’, it will take and leave [one] in that place [namely the heart or core of ourself, which is the source from which we have risen as ego]”, but there are two problems with this suggestion.<br>\n<br>\nFirstly, what he said in this passage of <i>Vicāra Saṅgraham</i> is ‘அதனை விடாது சும்மா இருந்தால்’ (<i>adaṉai viḍādu summā irundāl</i>), ‘Not letting go of that, if one just is’, in which ‘அதனை’ (<i>adaṉai</i>), ‘that’, refers to <i>sphuraṇa</i>, the fresh clarity that appears as ‘I am I’ when we keenly investigate what it is that shines as ‘I’; விடாது (<i>viḍādu</i>) means not leaving, abandoning or letting go of; and ‘சும்மா இருந்தால்’  (<i>summā irundāl</i>) means ‘if one just is’, thereby implying that we should just be without rising as ego to do anything. Therefore what he implies in this clause is that we should attend to this <i>sphuraṇa</i> so keenly and firmly that we do not allow our attention to be diverted away towards anything else, because attending to anything other than ourself is an action and hence the very antithesis of just being (<i>summā iruppadu</i>), so he did not mean that we should merely think ‘I am I’ (since thinking anything is an action) but that we should attend keenly to the awareness that always shines as ‘I am I’, but that we had formerly overlooked because, until we began to turn our attention back within to face ourself alone, we were mistakenly aware of ourself as ‘I am this body’.<br>\n<br>\nSecondly, the fact that in this sentence of <i>Nāṉ Ār?</i> a comma is generally printed after the first ‘நான்’ (<i>nāṉ</i>) indicates that what he meant by ‘நான், நான் என்று கருதிக்கொண்டிருந்தாலுங்கூட’ (<i>nāṉ, nāṉ eṉḏṟu karudi-k-koṇḍirundāluṅ-gūḍa</i>), “Even if one continues thinking ‘I, I’”, is mental repetition or <i>mānasika japa</i> of ‘I’ rather than continuously thinking ‘I am I’. However, though a comma has been printed after the first ‘நான்’ (<i>nāṉ</i>) in this sentence since at least as far back as the first edition of <i>Śrī Ramaṇa Nūṯṟiraṭṭu</i> (his collected works in Tamil), which was published in 1931, he did not actually write a comma after this first ‘நான்’ (<i>nāṉ</i>) in what is perhaps his original handwritten manuscript of the essay version of <i>Nāṉ Ār?</i>, a facsimile copy of which was printed on pages 43-7 of the <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ramanafiles/mountainpath/1993%20Aradhana.pdf\">June 1993 issue</a> of <a href=\"https://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/resource_centre/publications/mountain-path\"><i>The Mountain Path</i></a>, so there is a possibility that he intended to leave the clause ‘நான் நான் என்று கருதிக்கொண்டிருந்தாலுங்கூட’ (<i>nāṉ nāṉ eṉḏṟu karudi-k-koṇḍirundāluṅ-gūḍa</i>) open to be interpreted either as “Even if one continues thinking ‘I, I’” or as “Even if one continues thinking ‘I am I’”. In either case, what he implied in this sentence is that continuously thinking ‘I, I’ or ‘I am I’ can be a powerful aid to help us to direct our attention back within to face ourself and to keep it fixed on ourself, just as continuously thinking of a name of God can help one to keep one’s mind fixed on him.<br>\n<br>\nThat is, since any word generally refers to something, when we think of a word it brings to our mind whatever it refers to, so for example the noun ‘mango’ brings a particular fruit to our mind and the verb ‘run’ brings a particular action to our mind. Likewise, since the pronoun ‘I’ refers to ourself, the mere thought of the word ‘I’ brings ourself to our mind, so the benefit of thinking ‘I, I’, ‘I am, I am’ or ‘I am I’ is that it can help us to turn our attention back to ourself and thereby to become familiar with being self-attentive.<br>\n<br>\n<a name=\"un29\"></a>However, once we have become familiar with being self-attentive, it is no longer necessary for us to continue thinking such words, and sooner or later, in order to go deep in the practice of being self-attentive, we need to stop thinking anything at all, because though they refer only to ourself, even such words can become an unnecessary distraction, as he implies in the above passage of <i>Vicāra Saṅgraham</i> by the clause ‘வாக்காலும் நானென்று சொல்லாமலிருந்து’ (<i>vākkālum nāṉ-eṉḏṟu sollāmal-irundu</i>), “being without uttering ‘I’ even by word [or speech, whether physically or mentally]”, in the sentence, ‘ஆதலால், பிணமான தேகத்தைப் பிணம் போலவே இருத்தி, வாக்காலும் நானென்று சொல்லாமலிருந்து, இப்போது நானென விளங்குவது எதுவென்று கூர்மையாய் விசாரித்தால், அப்போது ஹிருதயத்தில், நான் நான் என்று சத்தமில்லாமல், தனக்குத்தானே ஓர் வித ஸ்புரிப்பு மாத்திரம் தோன்றும்’ (<i>ādalāl, piṇamāṉa dēhattai-p piṇam pōla-v-ē irutti, vākkālum nāṉ-eṉḏṟu sollāmal-irundu, ippōdu nāṉ-eṉa viḷaṅguvadu edu-v-eṉḏṟu kūrmaiyāy vicārittāl, appōdu hirudayattil, nāṉ nāṉ eṉḏṟu sattam-illāmal, taṉakku-t-tāṉē ōr vidha sphurippu māttiram tōṉḏṟum</i>), “Therefore, making the corpse-body remain as a corpse, and being without uttering ‘I’ even by word [or speech, whether physically or mentally], if one keenly investigates what it is that now shines as ‘I’, then in [one’s] heart a kind of <i>sphurippu</i> [a fresh clarity] alone will appear itself to itself [oneself to oneself] without sound as ‘I am I’”, and also by the first clause in the first sentence of <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2017/10/ulladu-narpadu-tamil-text.html#un29\">verse 29</a> of <i>Uḷḷadu Nāṟpadu</i>, “‘நான்’ என்று வாயால் நவிலாது, உள் ஆழ் மனத்தால் ‘நான்’ என்று எங்கு உந்தும் என நாடுதலே ஞான நெறி ஆம்” (<i>‘nāṉ’ eṉḏṟu vāyāl navilādu, uḷ āṙ maṉattāl ‘nāṉ’ eṉḏṟu eṅgu undum eṉa nāḍudal-ē ñāṉa-neṟi ām</i>), “Not saying ‘I’ by mouth, investigating by an inward sinking mind where one rises as ‘I’ alone is the path of <i>jñāna</i> [knowledge or pure awareness]”. Though in these two cases he uses the terms ‘வாக்காலும்’ (<i>vākkālum</i>), ‘even by word [speech, voice or mouth]’, and ‘வாயால்’ (<i>vāyāl</i>), ‘by mouth [word, speech or voice]’, both of which mean by mouth or speech, they also mean by word, so they imply not only uttered by speech but also uttered by mind, because in order to sink deep within ourself we need to keenly focus our entire attention on ourself alone and not allow it to be distracted even to the slightest extent by anything else whatsoever, not even by the word ‘I’ or the affirmation ‘I am I’, whether uttered by speech or by mind.<br>\n<br>\n<a name=\"sahaja\"></a><b>9.

If fire catches hold of a piece of camphor and is left undisturbed, it will continue burning until it has consumed the camphor completely, whereupon it will itself subside and be extinguished. Likewise, when the fire of <i>sphuraṇa</i> is ignited in our heart by our keenly investigating what it is that always shines as ‘I’, if we hold on to it without allowing our attention to be distracted away towards anything else, it will continue burning until it has consumed ego entirely along with all its <i>viṣaya-vāsanās</i> (inclinations to attend to anything other than itself), whereupon it will itself subside and be extinguished.<br>\n<br>\n<a name=\"vs06\"></a>In this passage of <i>Vicāra Saṅgraham</i>, after saying ‘தானும் சாந்தமாய்விடும்’ (<i>tāṉ-um śāntam-āy-viḍum</i>), ‘it [the <i>sphuraṇa</i>] will itself also be pacified [subside or be extinguished]’, he begins the next sentence saying, ‘இதுவே மோக்ஷம்’ (<i>iduvē mōkṣam</i>), ‘This alone is <i>mōkṣa</i> [liberation]’, and likewise in the sixth section of <i>Vicāra Saṅgraham</i> he says: ‘இவ்வித ஸ்புரிப்பு அடங்கின ஸூக்ஷ்மமான இடமே துரியாதீதம்’ (<i>i-v-vidha sphurippu aḍaṅgiṉa sūkṣmam-āṉa iḍamē turiyātītam</i>), ‘only the subtle place in which this kind of <i>sphurippu</i> subsides [or ceases] is <i>turiyātītam</i> [the transcendent state called ‘the fourth’, which is our natural state or <i>sahaja sthiti</i>]’. What exactly does he mean when he says that the <i>sphurippu</i> will cease, subside or be pacified or extinguished? In what sense will it cease or be extinguished?<br>\n<br>\nAs I explained above, what he means by the term <i>sphuraṇa</i> or <i>sphurippu</i> is the fresh clarity of self-awareness that shines forth as ‘I am I’ (that is, as awareness of ourself as ourself alone) when we turn our attention back towards ourself. The more keenly we attend to ourself, the more clearly the <i>sphuraṇa</i> will shine, and when we attend to ourself so keenly that we thereby cease to be aware of anything other than ourself, ego will instantly be swallowed by the perfect clarity of pure awareness, after which that clarity ‘I am I’ alone will remain shining eternally and without limit as ourself. Therefore when he says that the <i>sphuraṇa</i> will subside, cease or be extinguished, he does not mean that the clarity itself will subside or cease but only that its newness and freshness will subside and cease. In other words, the clarity of what we actually are, namely ‘I am I’, will cease to seem new or something that was not previously clear, because it will be clear that it is <i>sahaja</i>, our own real nature, and therefore our eternal and ever-undiminished awareness of ourself as ourself.<br>\n<br>\nThat is, when we know ourself as we actually are, we will see that the only thing that has ever actually existed is ‘I’, so we cannot ever have been anything other than that. In other words, I am only I, and I have never been and could never be anything other than I. Therefore though ‘I am I’ seems at first to be a <i>sphuraṇa</i>, a new and fresh clarity of self-awareness, it is actually not a new awareness but our eternal awareness of ourself as we always actually are. When we recognise this, namely that the clear awareness ‘I am I’ is not anything new but what is eternal and therefore natural (<i>sahaja</i>), that is what he describes as the subsidence, cessation, pacification or extinguishing of <i>sphuraṇa</i>.<br>\n<br>\n<a name=\"tanetan\"></a><b>10. ‘தானே தான்’ (<i>tāṉē tāṉ</i>), ‘oneself alone is oneself’, means that what we actually are is only ourself, which is beginningless, infinite and undivided <i>sat-cit-ānanda</i></b><br>\n<br>\n<a name=\"appala4\"></a>Therefore the closest we can come to expressing the ultimate truth about ourself accurately in words is not to say ‘अहं ब्रह्मास्मि’ (<i>ahaṁ brahmāsmi</i>), ‘I am <i>brahman</i>’, but only to say ‘अहम् अहम्’ (<i>aham aham</i>) or ‘நான் நான்’ (<i>nāṉ nāṉ</i>), ‘I am I’. However, what is important is not the words themselves, but the truth that is conveyed by such words, namely that we are nothing other than ourself, which is <i>sat-cit</i>, the fundamental awareness (<i>cit</i>) of our own existence (<i>sat</i>), which is what always shines within us as ‘I am’, so Bhagavan also expressed this truth using other words that conveyed the same meaning, such as ‘தானே தான்’ (<i>tāṉē tāṉ</i>), ‘oneself alone is oneself’. For example, in the last line of the <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2021/11/appala-pattu-appalam-song-tamil-text.html#appala4\">fourth and last verse</a> of <i>Appaḷa Pāṭṭu</i> he implies that the purpose of making the metaphorical ‘தன்மய அப்பளம்’ (<i>taṉmaya appaḷam</i>), ‘the <i>appaḷam</i> composed of that [<i>brahman</i>]’, is to eat it, and to eat it means ‘தானே தான் ஆக புஜிக்க’ (<i>tāṉē tāṉ āha bhujikka</i>), “to enjoy [or experience] as ‘oneself alone is oneself’”.<br>\n<br>\n<a name=\"aamm43\"></a>Likewise in <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2021/11/appala-pattu-appalam-song-tamil-text.html#aamm43\">verse 43</a> of <i>Śrī Aruṇācala Akṣaramaṇamālai</i> he says that ‘தானே தான்’ (<i>tāṉē tāṉ</i>), ‘oneself alone is oneself’, alone is தத்துவம் (<i>tattuvam</i>), the reality:<br>\n<blockquote>தானே தானே தத்துவ மிதனைத்<br>\nதானே காட்டுவா யருணாசலா<br>\n<br>\n<i>tāṉē tāṉē tattuva mitaṉait<br>\ntāṉē kāṭṭuvā yaruṇācalā</i><br>\n<br>\n<b>பதச்சேதம்:</b> தானே தானே தத்துவம். இதனை தானே காட்டுவாய் அருணாசலா.<br>\n<br>\n<b><i>Padacchēdam</i></b> (word-separation): <i>tāṉē tāṉē tattuvam. itaṉai tāṉē kāṭṭuvāy aruṇācalā</i>.<br>\n<br>\n<b>English translation:</b> Arunachala, oneself alone, oneself alone is the reality. Show this yourself.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Explanatory paraphrase:</b> Arunachala, oneself alone, oneself alone is the reality [or ‘oneself alone is oneself’ (‘I alone am I’) alone is the reality]. Show [me] this yourself.</blockquote>\nதான் (<i>tāṉ</i>) means oneself (or depending upon the context, myself, yourself, himself, herself or itself) and the suffix ஏ (<i>ē</i>) is an intensifier that implies alone, indeed or itself, so தானே (<i>tāṉē</i>) means ‘oneself alone’. Therefore the first sentence of this verse, ‘தானே தானே தத்துவம்’ (<i>tāṉē tāṉē tattuvam</i>) can be interpreted in two ways: it can mean either ‘oneself alone, oneself alone is the reality’, in which ‘தானே தானே’ (<i>tāṉē tāṉē</i>), ‘oneself alone, oneself alone’, is taken to be a repetition for emphasis, or “‘oneself alone is oneself’ alone is the reality”, in which ‘தானே தான்’ (<i>tāṉē tāṉ</i>), ‘oneself alone is oneself’, is taken to be a separate clause that serves as the subject of the sentence. These two interpretations are equally valid and complement each other, because whereas the first just emphasises that we ourself are the sole reality, the second further emphasises that what we ourself actually are is nothing other than ourself, ‘I alone am I’, and implies that awareness of ourself as ourself alone is itself the reality, because nothing other than ourself actually exists.<br>\n<br>\nIn this <a href=\"#av2\">second verse</a> of <i>Āṉma-Viddai</i>, after concluding the first sentence by saying that if we go within investigating ourself, thought will cease and in the cave of our heart <i>ātma-jñāna</i> (awareness of ourself as we actually are) will shine spontaneously as ‘I am I’, in the second sentence Bhagavan says ‘இதுவே மோனமே, ஏக வானமே, இன்ப தானமே’ (<i>iduvē mōṉamē, ēka vāṉamē, iṉba-tāṉamē</i>), ‘This alone is silence, the one space, the abode of bliss’. That is, <i>ātma-jñāna</i>, which is awareness of ourself as we actually are, namely as ‘I am I’, is our real nature, so it alone will remain when we investigate ourself so keenly that ego is eradicated and along with it all other thoughts cease forever. Therefore, since nothing other than <i>ātma-jñāna</i>, the pure awareness ‘I am I’, will then exist, it is infinite and eternal silence (<i>mauna</i>), the silence of pure being. It is also ‘the one space’ (<i>ēka vāṉam</i>), because it is ‘one only without a second’ (<i>ēkam ēva advitīyam</i>), and is therefore the infinite and empty space of pure awareness. Not only is it மோனமே (<i>mōṉamē</i>), the silence of pure being (<i>sat</i>), and ஏக வானமே (<i>ēka vāṉamē</i>), the one space of pure awareness (<i>cit</i>), but also the place of pure happiness (<i>ānanda</i>), so he concludes this verse by saying that it is இன்ப தானமே (<i>iṉba-tāṉamē</i>), ‘the place [or abode] of bliss’.<br>\n<br>\n<a name=\"uu28\"></a>In other words, our real nature (<i>ātma-svarūpa</i>), which is what shines eternally as ‘I am I’, is pure being-awareness-happiness (<i>sat-cit-ānanda</i>), which is beginningless (<i>anādi</i>), infinite (<i>ananta</i>) and undivided (<i>akhaṇḍa</i>), as he says in <a href=\"https://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2017/09/upadesa-undiyar-tamil-text.html#uu28\">verse 28</a> of <i>Upadēśa Undiyār</i>:<br>\n<blockquote>தனாதியல் யாதெனத் தான்றெரி கிற்பின்<br>\nனனாதி யனந்தசத் துந்தீபற<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;வகண்ட சிதானந்த முந்தீபற.<br>\n<br>\n<i>taṉādiyal yādeṉat tāṉḏṟeri hiṟpiṉ<br>\nṉaṉādi yaṉantasat tundīpaṟa<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vakhaṇḍa cidāṉanda mundīpaṟa</i>.<br>\n<br>\n<b>பதச்சேதம்:</b> தனாது இயல் யாது என தான் தெரிகில், பின் அனாதி அனந்த சத்து அகண்ட சித் ஆனந்தம்.<br>\n<br>\n<b><i>Padacchēdam</i></b> (word-separation): <i>taṉādu iyal yādu eṉa tāṉ terihil, piṉ aṉādi aṉanta sattu akhaṇḍa cit āṉandam</i>.<br>\n<br>\n<b>அன்வயம்:</b> தான் தனாது இயல் யாது என தெரிகில், பின் அனாதி அனந்த அகண்ட சத்து சித் ஆனந்தம்.<br>\n<br>\n<b><i>Anvayam</i></b> (words rearranged in natural prose order): <i>tāṉ taṉādu iyal yādu eṉa terihil, piṉ aṉādi aṉanta akhaṇḍa sattu cit āṉandam</i>.<br>\n<br>\n<b>English translation:</b> If one knows what the nature of oneself is, then beginningless, endless and unbroken existence-awareness-happiness.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Explanatory paraphrase:</b> If one knows what the nature of oneself is, then [what will remain existing and shining is only] <i>anādi</i> [beginningless], <i>ananta</i> [endless, limitless or infinite] and <i>akhaṇḍa</i> [unbroken, undivided or unfragmented] <i>sat-cit-ānanda</i> [existence-awareness-happiness].</blockquote>",
