    "content": "In my previous post, <a href=\"http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2007/03/please-note-for-few-weeks-i-will-not.html\">Please note â€“ for a few weeks I will not have internet access</a>, I wrote that for at least two weeks and perhaps longer I would not have an internet connection or access to my e-mail. That expected \"two weeks and perhaps longer\" turned out to be seven weeks, but I now have my internet connection again, and I expect it to be uninterruped for a while, except probably for ten days or so at the end of this month, and another ten days or so at the beginning of August.<br /><br />If you have sent me any e-mail since March 22nd, I apologise for not having replied earlier, and I will try to reply during the next week or so. I now have a backlog of more than a hundred e-mails to read and respond to, so I cannot reply to all of them immediately, but I will do so as soon as I can.",
